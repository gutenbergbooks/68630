<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Silesia, the autumn of 1757 was one of
frightful cold, of icy winds, of sunless days, and
freezing nights. The land, made desolate by the
contending armies of the Empress Queen, Maria
Theresa, and Frederick the Great, of Prussia, suffered
still more from this bitter and premature
winter. The miserable inhabitants, many of
them houseless, died by thousands, of cold and
starvation. The wretched remnant of cattle left
them perished; the fields lay untilled, the mills
were only piles of charred ruins, and desolation
brooded over the land. War could add but little
more to the miseries of this unfortunate region;
but Frederick of Prussia and the lion-hearted Empress
of Austria fought as fiercely as they had
done sixteen years before when the Titanic combat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
had first begun. Rosbach had been fought&mdash;that
terrible battle in which Frederick prevailed
against the Austrians, who were assisted by the
soldiers of France and the money of England.
The Austrians and French had, at first, attempted
an orderly retreat; but the piercing cold, the constant
fall of snow, and the difficulties of subsistence,
had very much interfered with this. Their
object was to reach Prince Charles of Lorraine,
in northwest Silesia, and many small bodies of
troops succeeded in maintaining their organization
until they joined Prince Charles. Others
were not so fortunate; soldiers found themselves
without officers, and officers found themselves
without men. In this last case was Captain St.
Arnaud, of the French regiment of Dufour, a
young gentleman who had exchanged his commission
in the King’s Musketeers, the most royal
of all the royal guards, for a line regiment where
he could see service. It cannot be denied that this
decision on Captain St. Arnaud’s part surprised
his world, for he was a curled darling among the
ladies, and the most superlative dandy in Paris.
And, wonderful to say, he still looked the superlative
dandy on the afternoon of the coldest day
he ever felt in his life, amid the snowy wastes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>of Silesia, when, after two weeks of starving and
running away from the Prussians, it looked as if
the inevitable hour had come. There was, yet,
not a speck upon his handsome uniform; his long,
light hair lay in curls upon his shoulders&mdash;he had
admired his own locks too much to cover them up
with a periwig; and his delicate, handsome face,
now gaunt and pale, was exquisitely shaven.
Clearly, starving did not agree with his constitution.
His whole life before that campaign had
been spent in the courts and camps of kings, and
he had missed those hardening and fortifying influences
which is Fate’s rough way of benefiting
her favorites. But faint and weak and hopeless
as he seemed, his soul was still unconquered, and
his eyes looked bravely around upon the desolate
waste before him. The cold, already intense, was
becoming severer every hour. St. Arnaud, being
naturally of a reflective nature, which he hid under
a mask of the utmost levity, was thinking to himself,
as he patted the neck of his lean and patient
horse, “The whole social order depends on the
mercury in the tube. At a certain point, varying
in different races, all distinctions are abolished.
If my general were here this moment, I would be
as good as he; for the best man would be he who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>could keep up his circulation best. And if my
orderly were here&mdash;bah! he could only deprive me
of my last chance of living through this night by
rubbing down my horse for me, which exercise
would keep my blood in circulation and increase
the poor beast’s chances of carrying me through to
the end.” His piercing eyes had swept the view
in front of him, but he almost jumped out of his
saddle as a voice at his elbow said: “My Captain!
I salute you!”</p>

<p>Close behind him, on a very good horse, sat a
young private soldier of St. Arnaud’s company.
St. Arnaud at once recognized him; he was so tall,
so fresh coloured, so well made that he attracted
attention in the ranks; but private soldiers to St.
Arnaud represented not names, but numbers. He
thought this young fellow was 472 on the regimental
roll, but had no idea of his name. He was
a contrast to St. Arnaud in every way; for besides
being a perfect picture of physical well-being,
the young soldier was in rags. In one the inner
man had suffered, in the other the outer man.
Having spoken, the young man awaited speech
from his officer with as much coolness as if he
were on parade at Versailles, instead of being alone
with him at nightfall in a frozen desert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>“I recognize you,” said St. Arnaud, after a moment;
“where are the others of your company?”</p>

<p>“I am the only man left, sir,” replied the soldier;
“as you know, we were very much cut up
that villainous day at Rosbach; and when you
were swept from us, in that last charge, we had
already lost half our men. I don’t know how it was,
sir; certainly it was not the fault of our officers”&mdash;with
another salute&mdash;“but I believe ours was
the worst demoralized regiment in the French
forces after Rosbach, and my company was the
worst demoralized in the regiment. We had not
an officer left above a corporal, but the handful
of us could have remained together. Instead of
doing that, it was <i>sauve qui peut</i> with all of us.
Note, sir, I do not say we did not fight like devils
at Rosbach; but being unused to defeat, we did
not know how to take it. I cannot tell you how it
is I come to be here alone; only I know that I,
with twenty others, started out to make our way
toward Prince Charles, and one by one the men
dropped off, until yesterday morning, when, at
sunrise, I found myself alone where I had bivouacked
the night before with three comrades.
They had gone off in the night, or early in the
morning, to follow a road I did not believe would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>lead us where we wanted to go. I came this way,
and well it was for me.”</p>

<p>The young soldier’s story, told jauntily, produced
a singular effect on St. Arnaud. He had
kept on hoping that, in spite of the accident of
his being separated from his command&mdash;an accident
caused by his own impetuosity carrying him
too far in advance of his men&mdash;he would yet find
his own personal command intact. But there was
no more room for hope in the face of what was
before his eyes and ringing in his ears. His
countenance became so pale with grief and chagrin
that he seemed about to drop from his saddle.
He laid the reins on his horse’s neck, and
raised both arms above his head in a gesture of
despair, but he said no word. The soldier, after
waiting vainly for a question or an answer, spoke
again.</p>

<p>“We have no time to lose, sir; we must cross
this plain before night. I have some forage here
and something in my haversack, and if we can get
a fire we can live.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud, still silent, mechanically gathered
up the reins again, and the horse instinctively
made for a faint track beaten through the snow.
The soldier followed, ten paces behind. On they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>travelled for an hour or two. As the sickly sun
sank below the fringe of dun clouds in the west
the cold became more terrible. A fierce wind set
in, which drifted furious flurries of snow across
the vast, white plain; and when the sky showed
black against the white earth, neither man nor
horse could travel farther. There was not a tree
or even a bush in sight. They had passed a few
dead horses on the dreary waste, but that was the
only thing that broke the ghastly monotony of the
way. Now they involuntarily halted, and each
knew that from then until sunrise they would be
fighting with the cold for life. The thought came
back to St. Arnaud, who had scarcely spoken a
word to his companion, how calamity levels all distinctions.
It would not have surprised him in the
least if, when he dismounted, and mechanically
threw the reins to the soldier, to have heard him
say: “Take care of your own horse, and I will
attend to mine.” Instead of this, the soldier only
pointed to a little hillock near by, and said: “That
place, sir, is a little sheltered from the wind. It
will do us good to walk there.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud, whose faculties seemed frozen,
obeyed the soldier. As he was tramping through
the half darkness, his eyes blinded by the snow,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>and the icy blast nearly cutting him to pieces, he
heard a shout of joy behind him. The soldier had
suddenly stumbled upon something which was
worth to them at that moment all the gold in the
Bank of France. It was nothing less than a broken
gun-carriage, of which a few inches of the wheel
appeared above the snow. The soldier dashed
toward it, and tugged and pulled at it, shouting
out exclamations of joy, as a man will who has
found that which will give him life. St. Arnaud
watched him dully as he wrenched such of it apart
as he could, and dragging it to the sheltered spot
under the hillock, where St. Arnaud held the
trembling horses, scooped out a hole in the snow,
and with a flint and steel struck a flash of fire.</p>

<p>At first, the flame flickered tamely; then, suddenly,
it burst into a glory of light and warmth.
St. Arnaud advanced, still leading the poor horses,
who gazed at the flames with an intelligent joy,
almost human.</p>

<p>By that time it was so black overhead and so
white underfoot, and the swirling snow was so
whipped about by the furious north wind, that it
seemed as if the two men and the two shivering
horses were alone in a universe of cold and snow
and blackness. The young soldier first gave the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>horses the feed they had carried, and melting
some snow in a tin pan he carried in his knapsack,
gave them to drink. Then, washing out the
pan, he produced some bacon and cheese and
black bread. St. Arnaud showed the first sign of
interest so far, by handing out his canteen, of
which one whiff caused the young soldier’s wide
mouth to come open with a grin, that showed the
whitest teeth imaginable. And then, huddling
under their cloaks, officer and soldier shared their
first meal together. That day month St. Arnaud
had been entertained by a countess in one of the
finest houses in Vienna, and the young soldier had
fared sumptuously in the kitchen with the maids;
but to-night they were supping together, and only
too glad to sup at all. At last, all the bacon and
cheese being devoured, St. Arnaud’s spirit seemed
to rouse from its torpor. He looked at the soldier
attentively and asked:</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Ameeltone,” was the response.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud’s French ear did not detect the
strange pronunciation of the name, yet he could
not quite make it out.</p>

<p>“Can you spell it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. H-a-m-i-l-t-o-n&mdash;Ameeltone.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>
<p>“But that is English.”</p>

<p>“Yes; my name is English all over. Gavin is
my first name”&mdash;and he pronounced it Garvan.</p>

<p>“Have you any English blood in you?”</p>

<p>“I have not a drop of any but English blood,
my Captain. My father, Sir Gavin Hamilton, is
an Englishman; and my mother, God bless her,
is Lady Hamilton.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said St. Arnaud, very naturally,
“what are you doing as a trooper in Dufour’s
regiment?”</p>

<p>“Because,” replied Gavin, taking up the tin pan
and scooping out the last remnants of their supper,
“my father is a great rascal.” And he
washed the pan out with snow.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud, accustomed to the extreme filial
respect of the French for their parents, felt a shock
at Gavin’s cool characterization of his father, and
said in reply:</p>

<p>“A man sometimes has cause for resentment
against his father, but seldom calls him a rascal.”</p>

<p>“True, my Captain,” cheerfully replied Gavin,
“but my father is a terrible rascal. He has ill-used
my mother, the finest creature God ever made.
What do you think of a man with a great fortune
deserting his wife and child in a foreign land
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>and then using all his power to make her admit she
is not his wife, when he knows she is; and when
he finds she has a soul not to be terrified, trying
to fool her into a divorce? But I tell you, my Captain,
my mother is a brave lady. She told him and
wrote him that she was his lawful wife, and that
she would defend me&mdash;I was a little boy then&mdash;that
she would have no divorce, lest it reflect on me,
and that no one of my rights would be bartered
away by her. And at that very time she could
barely keep body and soul together by giving lessons
in Paris. She is well educated, luckily, being
an English officer’s daughter. The English laws
are hard on poor and friendless women, and being
in France, too, my mother had little chance to
prove her rights. She looked to me, however, to
be able one day to maintain all she had claimed;
and she taught me carefully, so that, as she said,
when I came to the condition and estate of a gentleman,
I might know how to bear myself. She
did not wish to go back to England, where she knew
persecution awaited her, and brought me up as
much an English boy as she could in France. The
only thing that troubled her was my pronunciation&mdash;she
always laughs when I pronounce my own
name. I have an English way of using my fists
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>when I am angry. She scolds me, but I know her
brothers fought like that when they were lads at
school.”</p>

<p>“How came you to join the army?”</p>

<p>“Faith, sir, I had no choice. The King’s recruiting
officers came after me, and I had to go.
But I cannot say I regretted it, for I could never
have been anything else but a soldier, and I have
a better chance to rise in the army than in any
of the humble callings open to me in civil life.
My mother said it was best&mdash;that I came of good
fighting stock on her side&mdash;her brothers were officers,
and as far back as she knows her ancestors
they were mostly in the army and navy.”</p>

<p>The fire was burning brightly now; they were
warmed through, their hunger was appeased, and
so comfortable was their situation that they were
both in a mood to entertain and be entertained.
A fire in the snow and a supper of cheese and
bacon meant luxury to St. Arnaud now, who had
been brought up in palaces, and he found himself
listening to Gavin’s story with the same interest
that the Arab in the parching desert listens to the
story-teller who makes him forget all his miseries.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see your father?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Once. My father was sent to the court of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>Empress Queen on a diplomatic mission. He
passed secretly through Paris and sent for me. I
went with the sole idea that he might do justice to
my mother. But I might have saved my shoe
leather. However, what I did that day to my
father is written to my credit in heaven’s books,
for I mauled him well, and I was but eighteen&mdash;I
am only nineteen now.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud could not refrain from a look of disapproval,
and Gavin, noting it, asked at once, with
the greatest <i>naïveté</i>:</p>

<p>“But he spoke abominably of my mother, and
any man who speaks one disrespectful word of her&mdash;he
is my enemy, and I am his. Would not you
do the same by your mother?”</p>

<p>And St. Arnaud involuntarily answered “Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” continued Gavin, rising to his
feet, “are you surprised that I should think
I did a righteous act in flying at Sir Gavin?
He is a strong, well-made man, though not
so big as I am now, and as I took him by
surprise, I succeeded in knocking him off his
chair before he had got out half he had meant
to say about my mother. His valet came running
in then, and Sir Gavin, smiling as he wiped some
blood off his face, sent the man away. Oh, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>was a cool one! He smiled all the time we were
together, and he laughed aloud when I called myself
Gavin Hamilton.</p>

<p>“‘Garvan Ameeltone!’ he cried, mocking me.”</p>

<p>Gavin was now thoroughly inspired by his own
eloquence. He stood up and put his hands behind
his back, English fashion, while repeating his
father’s words and mimicking him in an odd,
drawling voice. St. Arnaud fully believed in the
scene that Gavin not only told, but acted before
him. Even the two horses, tethered close to the
red circle of light, lifted their heads, attracted by
the ringing human voice, and seemed to be listening
attentively to the story of Gavin Hamilton’s
wrongs and revenges.</p>

<p>“My father then, instead of being angry with
me, seemed to like me the better, and offered me
everything&mdash;everything if I would abandon my
mother. He would acknowledge me as his son,
according to both the French and English law, for
I was born in France; he would promise never to
marry again, and I don’t know what else beside.
It was then my turn to laugh. I said: ‘Wait until
I am twenty-one, and then see if I do not prove I
am your son. And as for marrying again, you
dare not in my mother’s lifetime.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>“There was an hour-glass in the room, and Sir
Gavin said to me: ‘In about twenty minutes all
the sand will have run out of that glass. I give you
until then to accept my offer.’ For answer I
smashed the hour-glass on the hearth. It was then
he spoke insultingly of my mother, and it was then
that I think I laid up treasures in heaven by the
way I pounded him. I got several good blows at
him before that rascal of a valet came in and pulled
me off.”</p>

<p>The wind was howling so, and the gusts of snow
so driven between them, that St. Arnaud drew
close to Gavin to hear the rest of the story. Gavin,
who was thoroughly enjoying the recital of his
affair, stopped long enough to throw some of the
iron work of the gun-carriage into the fire, when
it speedily grew red hot, and glowed radiantly,
adding materially to the warmth. He then resumed,
in response to the interest plain in St. Arnaud’s
face:</p>

<p>“I trudged back to our garret, where my mother
was waiting for me. It was a cold evening, and
my mother had a little fire for me&mdash;fuel is cruelly
dear in Paris, isn’t it, my Captain?&mdash;and she also
had something for me to eat. She let me be
warmed and filled before asking me any questions,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>for my mother has that English coolness which
nothing seems able to disturb. When I was
through eating I told her about the interview. I
told her all except the words Sir Gavin had used
about her, but I said they were such as no man,
father or no father, should speak of her without
being made to suffer all I could make him suffer
for it. Then my mother suddenly burst into tears,
and taking my face between her hands, kissed me,
and said some of those sweet things that women
say to those they love; and I replied: ‘What matters
it about his threats and promises? You are
his wife; I am his son and heir. Wait until I am
twenty-one, and I will go to England and proclaim
it all. If Sir Gavin Hamilton deals with us thinking
he is dealing with a helpless woman and a boy,
he will find we are not quite so helpless as he
fancies we are. The notion that I, within three
years of my majority, would make a bargain with
him! It is absurd!’”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” replied St. Arnaud, “and his anxiety
to make a bargain with you shows that he
knows you will have to be reckoned with.”</p>

<p>Then, drawing his watch from his pocket, he
said: “We must divide the watch to-night. I will
take the first hour until one in the morning. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>fire will last the night, and rubbing the horses
down will warm us up.”</p>

<p>Gavin then discovered that St. Arnaud meant
the distinction between officer and private to be
overlooked. They both went to work on their
horses, and for fifteen minutes nothing more was
said. Gavin had a small supply of forage, and
he noticed that St. Arnaud had a large haversack
strapped to his saddle. Gavin hoped that it was
something to sustain life in man or beast; but
presently, both having got through with their
horses, St. Arnaud, noticing for the first time
Gavin’s tattered clothes, said:</p>

<p>“You are ill-clad for such weather as this.
Yonder in my haversack is a second uniform, which
you may have. You see, I am not used to running
away, and carried with me clothes, when I
should have taken food.”</p>

<p>Gavin’s eyes sparkled. He fetched the haversack,
and tore it open. A change of delicate linen,
some toilet articles, and a handsome new uniform
tumbled out. Gavin was in ecstasy when he saw
the uniform.</p>

<p>“Oh, my Captain,” he cried, “do you mean this
for me? I have longed&mdash;yes, longed to wear an
officer’s uniform; and I have a presentiment that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>if I once take off a private soldier’s coarse clothes,
I shall never again wear them.”</p>

<p>And as quick as lightning he slipped off his
rags, jumped into the uniform, and then, in the
excess of his delight, he gave three loud and ear-piercing
huzzas, that were half lost in the tumult
of the wind. At the same moment he threw his
own tattered clothes as far as he could swing
them, the wind seizing and scattering them; next,
he dashed away the dragoon’s sabre which he carried.</p>

<p>“There you go,” he shouted; “you never were
any good as a weapon, and I will replace you by an
officer’s sword with a gold handle. And meanwhile
I will defend myself with my horse-pistol!”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud laughed until the tears came into his
eyes. He had not in a month been so amused and
interested as in this young man, so strangely
found, and to whom he owed his life by the finding him.
Gavin looked a little sheepish at St. Arnaud’s
laughter, but was compensated by his next
words.</p>

<p class="p2b">“You are a fine-looking fellow, and you have the
bearing of an officer. Why is it I never recognized
you in the regiment?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="illo2"><img src="images/i_018.jpg" width="500" alt="GAVIN THROWS AWAY HIS TROOPER’S SABRE"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">GAVIN THROWS AWAY HIS TROOPER’S SABRE</p>

<p class="p2">“I can’t say. I only know it was not because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>I did not want to be recognized. But I knew you,
my Captain, and often looked at you as you stepped
along so elegant, so debonair, with such beautiful
cambric handkerchiefs, and such small polished
boots. I heard, too, that your quarters were like
a lady’s boudoir, and you had a private wagon to
carry your clavier and <i>viol da gamba</i>!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied St. Arnaud, somewhat ruefully.
“I shall know better in my next campaign.”</p>

<p>Gavin, then rolling himself in his blanket, lay
down before the fire. By its red light his dark,
upturned eyes could be seen, and they were full of
hope and even joy. Defeat and disaster were
lightly taken by this young soldier. In a little
while, though, he was sleeping, with the soft, low
breathing of a baby.</p>

<p>Beyond the red circle of the fire all was blackness,
and, except the roaring of the wind, all was
silence. A few stars flickered dimly in the cold
heavens above them, but they were often obscured
by the flurries of snow. St. Arnaud sat still in
front of the fire, for it was not yet necessary to
walk up and down to keep alive. His face was
pale and impassive, and he was still suffering from
the shock of flight and defeat. It seemed to him
as if a hundred years separated him from the year
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>before, or even the month before. The hours
dragged by toward midnight. Every moment it
grew colder, but the fire still lasted. At last, at
one o’clock, St. Arnaud waked Gavin, who rose
instantly. St. Arnaud showed him a pocket thermometer,
with the mercury down to zero.</p>

<p>“That’s nothing,” cried Gavin jauntily. “I
will throw some of the iron of the gun-carriage on
the fire, and if I see you freezing, I will wake you
up, never fear.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud lay down and, covered with Gavin’s
blanket, soon fell asleep. Gavin watched him all
the time, thinking:</p>

<p>“Some men in my place would think themselves
unfortunate at this moment. I don’t. This is my
first real stroke of fortune. I have an officer’s
uniform&mdash;<i>parbleu!</i> what may I not expect in the
way of good luck!”</p>

<p>Absorbed in a delicious dream of the future, the
rest of the night seemed short to Gavin. A ghastly
half light succeeded the darkness; and then all at
once a pale rose colour appeared in the eastern sky,
and a faint golden haze overspread the snow-covered
earth. The distant mountains glowed in an
opaline light&mdash;it was the dawn of the cloudless winter
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>Gavin, however, beyond the thrill which morning
brings to men of his youth and type, noticed
nothing, being occupied with the horses, and with
the preparation of the last of his cheese and bacon
in the tin pan. When it was ready he waked St.
Arnaud, who was sleeping soundly.</p>

<p>“Come, my Captain,” he called out. “We are
both alive. There is something to eat. The
weather is fair, and the sun is rising. And faith!
I feel as if I would like to right about face and
go back to fighting those confounded Prussians
again.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud got up instantly. In fifteen minutes
they had finished all they had to eat, had mounted,
and were travelling along the faint track in the
snow which indicated the highroad. As they
turned their horses’ heads, St. Arnaud said to
Gavin:</p>

<p>“Ride by me.” And Gavin, without the least
impertinence, replied firmly:</p>

<p>“I meant to. No man in an officer’s uniform
rides behind his captain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Arnaud</span> and Gavin travelled all that day
through a scene of desolation, but the sun shone,
and they were approaching a part of the country
where at least food could be had, and their circumstances
seemed so much improved, that all at once
the world took on an altogether different aspect.
No man could long endure, and live, the hideous
depression from which St. Arnaud had suffered
since Rosbach; and when his soul made a final
rally, it was to perch upon heights of hope and
joy. He felt sure they would beat Frederick of
Prussia, and one short month would see a revival
of the fortunes of the Empress Queen. He so expressed
himself to Gavin, who had never suffered
any depression whatever. And each found a source
of vivid interest in the other’s personality. St.
Arnaud had never met a man in the least like this
young French-Englishman, and the story of the
mother, the woman who was Lady Hamilton by
right, starving and freezing with her child, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>always working in her miserable attic in a great
foreign city, was moving to him. He saw that the
son of such a mother would be of tough fibre. As
for Gavin, St. Arnaud’s beauty, grace, and superior
knowledge of the world were so captivating, that
the riding by his side in an officer’s uniform was
an intoxicating pleasure.</p>

<p>“Often,” thought Gavin to himself, looking
sidewise at St. Arnaud’s clear and handsome profile,
“have I watched you at parade, and longed&mdash;oh,
how I have longed&mdash;to be on equal terms with
you. I shall be yet, because I am resolved, if a
man has any share in his own destiny, to be one
day a sublieutenant; and then&mdash;pouf! the rest is
easy.” He would have dearly liked to ask St.
Arnaud questions, but he remembered that, although
they rode side by side, he was still a private
soldier. St. Arnaud, however, took the privilege
of an officer, and questioned Gavin freely.</p>

<p>“Can you read and write?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Like a notary,” replied Gavin promptly.
“My mother took good care to give me an excellent
English education herself, and she was well
qualified, too. Often has she taught me out of
her head when she would be working at her needle
for a living, for to that has Sir Gavin Hamilton
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>reduced my mother; and he wanted me to go home
and live with him&mdash;may the devil take him now
and forever! My mother taught me also a little
Latin, a little Spanish, and I myself learned a good
deal of German from those Austrian allies of
ours.”</p>

<p>“You far excel me,” responded St. Arnaud,
“and yet I had the best teachers in France.”</p>

<p>At which Gavin replied proudly: “I can ask for
wine in four languages.”</p>

<p>“I only wish you had a chance to ask for it in
one&mdash;to make signs, for that matter.”</p>

<p>They rode on in silence for a few moments, when
Gavin spoke again.</p>

<p>“My Captain,” he said in a coaxing voice, “I
have something to ask of you&mdash;a favour&mdash;such a
favour as a man asks but once in a lifetime.”</p>

<p>“Considering that my meeting you last night
saved my life, I should feel a little awkward in
refusing you anything I could grant.”</p>

<p>“It is this, then. You see, I have on this uniform.
As long as I wear it the world thinks me
an officer. Let me wear it, and let me dream
myself a lieutenant until we reach the army of
Prince Charles! Our regiment is scattered; it
may never be reorganized; and as soon as we join
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>Prince Charles there will be fighting, and what
glorious chances has a soldier then! Give me but
one chance under fire, and I promise you I will
come out of it so that I will be made an officer in
truth.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud stopped, amazed at Gavin’s presumption;
but one look at his face, his eyes glowing
with furious entreaty, checked the peremptory
refusal upon his lips. Instead he said:</p>

<p>“You will be discovered.”</p>

<p>“Certainly; but a general who discovers a private
soldier, by birth a gentleman, who is known
to be brave and loyal&mdash;for that I am, and challenge
any man to say nay&mdash;wishing and deserving to be
an officer, will make him one. The French army is
not like the Austrian, or even these pigs of Prussians.”</p>

<p>“You will discover yourself&mdash;betray yourself, in
short, in whatever society you find yourself. No
one will take you for an officer.”</p>

<p>“I think I told you I was the son of Lady Hamilton,”
responded Gavin coldly.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud hesitated for a moment or two; then,
with a brilliant smile, holding out his hand to
Gavin, he said:</p>

<p>“Every word I have spoken was against the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>impulse of my heart. You are an officer now, as
far as I can make you; and trust me, when we
reach Prince Charles, he shall hear your story
first from me.”</p>

<p>Gavin, who was usually glib of speech, became
silent under the influence of strong emotion. He
only held St. Arnaud’s hand in a grip that was
like steel. Presently releasing it, he said:</p>

<p>“My life is yours&mdash;I have nothing more now to
offer.” Then, suddenly recovering himself, he
cried joyfully: “Oh, that my mother could see me
now! It fretted her proud soul to see me a private
soldier, but she said no word. And if I only remember
all she told me, I will prove myself a
gentleman. She was, as I told you last night,
always preparing me for something higher. She
made me learn English table manners even when
we had precious little to eat. And wash! Those
English are mad about soap and water. My
mother has washed me when I was a little lad
until I shrieked for mercy; but scrub, wash, wash,
scrub, every day, and twice a day. Illness, cold,
nothing excused me from that infernal tub. But
at last I got to like it; and now I like cold water
as well as any whale that swims the Arctic seas.
Here is the proof.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>Gavin produced with great pride a small, round
lump tied with strings, and on the strings being
cut, it expanded into a huge sponge.</p>

<p>“And this&mdash;and this&mdash;and this&mdash;” he added,
handing out some coarse soap, a comb, and a razor.</p>

<p>For reply, St. Arnaud produced not only a
sponge, but a small towel, a cake of scented soap,
a silver comb, and a pearl-handled razor. Gavin’s
eyes gleamed. “These will I have when I am an
officer!” he cried.</p>

<p>They resumed their way. The joy that shone in
Gavin’s face was contagious. St. Arnaud smiled
at the thought that a suit of clothes and the hope
of a sublieutenancy could give so much happiness
to any one; but he did not know that it meant all
which the young soldier coveted in life.</p>

<p>That day they entered a tract of country where
an occasional house still stood; and they even
found an inn, soon after midday, where they got
a coarse but abundant meal. After that the aspect
of the country steadily improved, and in the early
winter dusk they found themselves approaching
a comfortable country mansion with pleasure
grounds around it. The windows were tightly
barred, but smoke was pouring from one of the
chimneys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“Now, my young sublieutenant,” cried St. Arnaud,
laughing, “we will find gentlepeople in this
pleasant bivouac; and, remember, you are an officer.
Don’t call me ‘my Captain,’ and whatever
you do, don’t show any subservience to me. Contradict
me occasionally, and when I say it is a certain
time by my watch, say my watch is fast or
slow&mdash;anything to show we are on an equality.”</p>

<p>“I will remember,” answered Gavin gravely.</p>

<p>Dismounting before the door, Gavin began a rat-tat-tat
which sounded like an earthquake. There
was no response, and after banging at the door
for five minutes he walked around the corner of
the house. There was a door leading into the
kitchen quarters, but it, too, was closely fastened.
The cold was becoming intense, and Gavin was
about to return to St. Arnaud and discuss the propriety
of breaking a window, when a man-servant
appeared upon the scene. He did not observe Gavin
in the half darkness, and, on hearing the heavy
clump of the rustic’s shoes, the kitchen door opened
an inch or two, and a maid, with a foolish, frightened
face, whispered:</p>

<p>“Get the other one to help you with the wood-basket;
we must have the wood in the house at
once. But be quiet about it, for there has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>a great pounding at the front door, and we don’t
wish to let any one in.”</p>

<p>Gavin then noticed a great, two-handled basket
piled with wood such as the huge stoves of the
region required. The man went off to get help
in lifting it, and an idea jumped into Gavin’s
mind. “I’ll get in the house and open the door
for St. Arnaud,” thought he; and as soon as the
man’s back was turned he went to the basket,
softly removed some of the wood, crawled in, and,
artistically arranging a few sticks so as to conceal
himself, waited some minutes. Then the servant,
with another one, approached; a stout pole was
run between the two handles, and the basket, with
Gavin and the logs, was picked up, carried through
the kitchen, then into a long corridor, and finally
to the main entrance hall, where there was a vast
porcelain stove. At that moment Gavin heard a
light step descending the stairs, and an exquisitely
sweet voice say:</p>

<p>“How can you let those poor creatures outside
suffer in this cold? I order you to open the door
immediately.”</p>

<p>“But, madame,” said the maid, who had followed,
“we had express orders from the master
and mistress to let no one in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>At this moment the basket was let down, and in
another instant Gavin, having disengaged himself
with quiet dexterity from the wood, stepped out
of the basket, and making his best bow, said in
his best German: “Madame, I will obey your
orders, if these louts will not,” and running to the
door, drew the bolt, and in walked Captain St.
Arnaud.</p>

<p>The two men-servants gaped in grotesque horror
at the load they had brought in; the maid began
to scream violently; only the lady retained her self-possession.</p>

<p>“To whom am I indebted,” she asked of Gavin
with perfect composure, “for carrying out my orders
with such unexpected promptness?”</p>

<p>“To Sublieutenant Gavin Hamilton, of Dufour’s
regiment of dragoons, in the service of His
Majesty of France,” replied Gavin with equal coolness,
saying to himself meanwhile, “Aha! St. Arnaud
will see that I have the composure of a gentleman.”
Then he said, “Permit me, madame, to
present Captain St. Arnaud of my regiment.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud bowed with the utmost gravity, although
immensely tickled at Gavin, and the three
gentlepeople stood entirely at ease, while the three
servants were completely disconcerted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>“I am Madame Ziska,” said the lady of the
charming voice, speaking in French. “I am running
away from the Prussians toward Vienna.
This house belongs to acquaintances of mine, who
have left it. The servants in charge, knowing me,
gave me permission to remain the night here; and
although I had no authority to let any one else in,
I certainly should have opened the door had not
Lieutenant Hamilton done so for me.”</p>

<p>Neither cold nor hunger nor flight had dulled
either St. Arnaud’s or Gavin’s appreciation of
beauty and charm. There was no great beauty in
Madame Ziska, but an exquisite grace of bearing,
a face full of expression, and a beautiful figure.
She was one of those women whose age it was impossible
to tell. She was, in truth, thirty, but she
might have been twenty-five or thirty-five. Nor
was her nationality apparent either in her appearance
or her language, for her French was immaculate;
and neither St. Arnaud nor Gavin Hamilton
knew enough of the German language to judge of
how she spoke it when she addressed the servants.
St. Arnaud thought first of the poor beasts outside,
and said to the men-servants: “Have our horses
attended to at once, and look for either money or
kicks, according to how you do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>The two men disappeared, and the maid, apparently
profiting by the suggestion of money, said
very respectfully:</p>

<p>“Supper is not yet ready, madame; and I will
add something for these gentlemen,” and disappeared.</p>

<p>Madame Ziska then led the way to a small sitting-room,
where a stove glowed, candles gleamed,
and a table was set with linen and plate. She
seated herself before the stove, and not until then
did St. Arnaud and Gavin proceed to warm their
chilled bodies. St. Arnaud watched Gavin closely,
but with amusement, as if he were assisting at the
first production of a new comedy, when he saw
this young private soldier of nineteen masquerading
as a gentleman. Gavin himself saw the joke,
and St. Arnaud could not refrain from bursting
out laughing when Gavin, surveying himself coolly
in a mirror on the wall, remarked:</p>

<p>“Madame, I am indebted to my brother officer
for these clothes&mdash;it is quite a story&mdash;and, <i>sacre!</i>
I hardly know myself in this rig.”</p>

<p>“But,” thought St. Arnaud, “wait until supper
is served. The table is a place to tell a man’s
up-bringing.”</p>

<p>The door opened, and the servants entered,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>bringing with them a very good supper. Gavin
rose instantly, and forestalled St. Arnaud in placing
a chair for Madame Ziska, at which the captain’s
heretofore smiling face assumed a scowl.
There is such a thing as learning a lesson too well
and too promptly. They seated themselves, and
a very jolly supper party they made. Madame
Ziska’s conversation proved as charming as her
appearance.  She talked with the utmost ease and
apparent frankness, but of her own condition in
life she said not a word. Yet, there was something
convincingly honest about her; and St. Arnaud,
who knew the world thoroughly, felt as much
confidence in her as did the unsophisticated Gavin.
He shrewdly suspected her to be a professional
artist of some description, who possessed, by some
chance, a higher degree of education and breeding
than was usual in those times. He treated her,
however, as if she had been a princess in her own
right, and Madame Ziska accepted it with perfect
dignity, as her just due.</p>

<p>Gavin had never before sat at table with an officer,
and he watched St. Arnaud quite as closely as
St. Arnaud watched him. He carried off his part
wonderfully well, but it was not quite perfection.
He laughed and talked too much, airing his sentiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
in the four languages he claimed to know,
which, except English and French, he spoke very
ungrammatically. St. Arnaud, pleasant but critical,
noticed all, while Madame Ziska’s sweet, inscrutable
smile revealed nothing. There was a
harpsichord in the room, and as soon as they had
finished supper St. Arnaud jumped up and, opening
it, burst into a sentimental song, accompanying
himself brilliantly. This was too much for Gavin,
who was so charmed that he altogether forgot the
part he was playing, and also the training his
mother had given him, and acted as he would at a
bivouac when a comrade sang a good song. In the
excess of his enjoyment he sat down on the floor,
close to the glowing stove, and after a while established
himself comfortably at full length, his head
resting on his elbows, which he dug into the carpet.
St. Arnaud saw it all out of the tail of his eye, until
Gavin, suddenly catching St. Arnaud’s amused
glance fixed on him, jumped up, red and embarrassed.</p>

<p>“That is for not remembering what my mother
told me,” he thought, with the deepest vexation.
“However,” he reflected again, “I shall soon overcome
the demoralization of camp manners in company
like this,” and he demurely seated himself on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>a sofa. The song closed in a beautiful cadenza,
but it was drowned in a tremendous tramping of
hoofs, and the maid-servants rushed in, bawling:</p>

<p>“The Prussians! The Prussians!”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud’s and Gavin’s first sensation was one
of stupid surprise. They had not thought a Prussian
to be within fifty miles. Madame Ziska,
however, showed not an instant’s discomposure. She
at once opened the door of a closet in the room, saying,
“It is strategy, not rashness, which is wanted
now;” and almost pushing them in, she took the
key out of the lock, and passed it to them in the
inside. Then, seating herself nonchalantly, she
trimmed the candles and took up a book to read.</p>

<p>It was so quickly done that neither St. Arnaud
nor Gavin had a connected thought until they
found themselves in the closet, nor could they recall
which one locked the door. They gazed stupidly
at each other in the half light which filtered
through the glass doors lined with green silk; and
then they found that, although concealed from
sight themselves, they could yet see any one in the
room through little holes in the moth-eaten silk
behind the glass.</p>

<p>The sound of many feet entering the house was
now heard, and in a moment more the door was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>opened, and a Prussian officer ushered in, a short,
slender man, wearing a shabby surtout and nondescript
uniform. Several other officers followed; but
from the moment the short, slender man entered,
neither one of the prisoners in the closet, nor had
Madame Ziska, eyes for any one but him.</p>

<p>His face was wan and weather-beaten, his nose
high and prominent, and his brow and mouth
rather unpleasing. But his gray-blue eyes redeemed
an otherwise sinister face. They were exquisitely clear,
soft yet sparkling, and their mild
expression flatly contradicted the hardness and
even cruelty of his other features.</p>

<p>He advanced to the stove, slightly and negligently
saluting Madame Ziska, who rose and bowed.
As he addressed no word to her, after standing a
moment she quietly reseated herself. The other
officers remained standing, and a shiver seemed to
run through them at Madame Ziska’s action. The
man in the nondescript uniform noticed it, and
smiled faintly. He sat down, warmed his hands at
the stove, while the officers stood rigidly at attention.
Madame Ziska read diligently, and St. Arnaud
and Gavin in the closet scarcely dared to
breathe.</p>

<p>After five minutes of this the shabby man looked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>around him, made a slight motion with his hand,
and every officer, saluting, filed out of the door,
and he was left alone with Madame Ziska.</p>

<p>Madame Ziska continued to read. Presently the
strange personage spoke to her in French, and in
the clearest and sweetest voice imaginable.</p>

<p>“You have a great deal of <i>sang froid</i>, madame.”</p>

<p>“One needs it in this bustling world,” replied
Madame Ziska calmly, withdrawing her eyes for
a moment from her book.</p>

<p>“Ahem!” A pause. “Your French is very good.”</p>

<p>“So is yours, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“It is the only language, after all.”</p>

<p>“You must be well up in the graces of His
Majesty, the King of Prussia, who loves everything
French, although he fights France.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes. You think me a major, or a colonel,
perhaps, in the King’s body-guard.”</p>

<p>“Majors and colonels do not have the staff that
came with you into this room just now. You are
a general at least.”</p>

<p>“No. Higher.”</p>

<p>“A field-marshal?”</p>

<p>“Higher still.”</p>

<p>“Prince Henry of Prussia?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>“Prince Henry rises when I speak to him.”</p>

<p>Madame Ziska rose and made him a profound
courtesy.</p>

<p>“Sire, you are the King of Prussia.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the announcement that the shabby man with
the sparkling and speaking eyes and the soft and
melodious voice was Frederick of Prussia, the
greatest captain of the age, the two men concealed
in the closet grew rigid with astonishment. They
did not need his careless, but confirmatory nod to
be convinced of his identity; but when he spoke it
was to say:</p>

<p>“Yes, I am the King of Prussia. A great many
people know me by sight&mdash;more do not. You are
evidently one of the latter class.”</p>

<p>Madame Ziska remained standing respectfully,
and answered Frederick’s last speech by saying:</p>

<p>“Your Majesty will not think me a flatterer
when I say I knew from the moment you entered
this room that you were no ordinary man.”</p>

<p>“And I knew,” said Frederick, with a faint
smile, which transfigured his whole face, “that you
were no ordinary woman when you faced half a
dozen strange men as you did. I should like to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>have a regiment of men as cool as you are. How
they would stand fire! Pray be seated. War is a
tiresome business,” he continued, after Madame
Ziska had resumed her chair. “But it is my
trade, and a man must work at his trade. However,
I like my tools&mdash;my soldiers.” Then, throwing
himself back in his chair, he kept on, as if
merely thinking aloud. “I am like the bourgeois&mdash;of
whom I have no great opinion&mdash;I am absorbed in
my trade. Time was when I had tastes; now ’tis
nothing but whether I can beat Prince Charles as
I did Marshal Soubise the other day. I like the
work less as time goes on; but I like other things
less still.”</p>

<p>“You still like music, your Majesty.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p>Madame Ziska rose, and stepping lightly up to
him, with the utmost grace and quickness drew
the pieces of a flute out of the pocket of his surtout,
and deftly screwed them together, evidently knowing
all about it. Then, putting the flute to her rosy
lips, she played a little French air, to which Frederick
listened enraptured.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he cried; “that carries me back to my
peaceful days at Ruppin, when my flute was my
only company for days together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>Madame Ziska, seeing that she had found something
in which he was interested, went to the harpsichord,
and seating herself, sang a French song in
a sweet, agreeable voice.</p>

<p>Frederick was charmed.</p>

<p>“Madame, have you any other accomplishments?”
he cried. “I have not sunk so far into
the savage as I thought, if music can still give me
such pleasure.”</p>

<p>Madame Ziska hesitated, a roguish smile playing
over her face.</p>

<p>“Did your Majesty say you played the little air
I tried just now on the flute?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. My sister, the Margravine of Baireuth,
first taught it to me, and accompanied me
on the harpsichord.”</p>

<p>He seized the flute and began playing, and Madame
Ziska, with the greatest coolness in the world,
picking up her skirts, executed a <i>pas de seul</i> that
was a wonder of skill and grace. The intricacy
of her steps was marvellous; she sprung into the
air and alighted on the point of her toe, and then
spun around with dazzling dexterity; her arms,
used with exquisite effect, seemed to have the
power of wings to support her; but when, with a
final bound and a sinking to the floor, and rising
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>with consummate grace, she was about to conclude
her dance, a knock came at the door. Madame
Ziska, with lightning quickness, seated herself demurely,
while the King, not to be behindhand, put
his flute behind him, and called out petulantly:</p>

<p>“Come in.”</p>

<p>An officer entered and, saluting, said:</p>

<p>“Did your Majesty call?”</p>

<p>“No,” tartly responded the King. “Did you
not hear me playing on my flute? A man must
have some recreation, and because I do not puff
smoke by the hour, nor gamble, nor make a beast
of myself with wine, I am not thereby without
tastes.”</p>

<p>The officer was so taken aback by this onslaught
that he hastily closed the door.</p>

<p>The effect of Madame Ziska’s dance was not less
electrifying to the two men in the closet than on the
King. St. Arnaud was somewhat surprised, but
Gavin’s eyes were nearly starting out of his head,
and St. Arnaud could scarcely keep from laughing,
although a laugh then would have cost him his life.</p>

<p>“There, madame!” said Frederick, when the
officer had hastily shut the door. “You see one
of the disadvantages of my calling. It would not
surprise my military family in the least if I were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>to be guilty of crimes and call them amusements;
but that I should occasionally play the flute never
fails to astonish them. Bah! But tell me this,”
he resumed, as Madame Ziska, panting after her
exercise, fanned herself. “How comes it that a
woman who dances in a manner worthy of the
Grand Opera at Paris should speak so well? Pardon
my bluntness; I have fallen into it, because the
women I see are chiefly court ladies who never
would have done talking, when once they begun, if
I did not use a little <i>brusquerie</i> with them occasionally.”</p>

<p>Madame Ziska laughed a singularly pleasant
and honest laugh. “I do myself not know,” she
replied, “except that as soon as I learned to read
I wished to put it to practice. I come of the very
bourgeoisie you were abusing just now; but circumstances
placed me with a certain person in particular
who was above me in station and highly educated,
and, naturally, I strove to raise myself to a
higher level than a mere dancer.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Where are you going now?”</p>

<p>“I am on my way to Vienna. Your Majesty has
fluted so to the Austrians and French that they are
always dancing&mdash;but not of my kind. And I am
going where I can find people who will think of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>some one else than your Majesty long enough to let
a poor artist make a living.”</p>

<p>“You may see the Empress Queen at Vienna,
but not exactly as you see me&mdash;ha! ha! However,
I will give you some tangible proof that you have
seen me.”</p>

<p>He fumbled in his pockets and brought out a
plain silver snuff-box with the royal cipher on it.
Then taking a penknife from his pocket, he
scratched on the lid, “Frédéric,” adding: “I, and
only I, so write my name.”</p>

<p>Madame Ziska’s conduct on receiving this was
quite different from what might have been expected
from her previous debonair behaviour. Her eyes
filled with tears, and she clasped her hands in
gratitude.</p>

<p>Within the closet, St. Arnaud and Gavin remained
breathless and noiseless as they thought.
But those clear, limpid eyes of Frederick’s saw
more than was apparent. He rose and, carelessly
approaching the door, raised the hilt of his sword,
and bringing it down with a thundering crash, the
glass door was shivered, the green silk torn apart,
and the two French officers stood revealed.</p>

<p>Gavin Hamilton thought afterward: “There is
something in being trained as an officer, after all,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>for, although as brave a man as St. Arnaud, he involuntarily
shrunk back into the closet when discovered;
but St. Arnaud, deliberately stepping out,
bowed to the ground and said with the utmost
suavity:</p>

<p>“Thanks, your Majesty. It was warm in
there; but we did not think of breaking the glass
for air!”</p>

<p>At this Frederick burst into a hearty laugh; the
coolness of St. Arnaud amused him. Madame
Ziska turned pale, but at the King’s ringing laugh
she recovered herself, and said, smiling roguishly:</p>

<p>“We are three to one, but we will spare your
Majesty!”</p>

<p>Frederick laughed again at this, and seeing Gavin
still trying to make himself small against the
wall of the closet, the King leant in, and taking
him by the collar, dragged him out, Gavin looking
very sheepish and blushing furiously. And then
the great King and the French officer, the private
soldier and the dancer all laughed together.</p>

<p>“Madame and messieurs,” cried Frederick,
“you may claim each to have conferred a great
favour on the King of Prussia; for I tell you I
have not laughed so heartily this year. I thought
I had forgotten how. Nor did I ever take a prisoner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
before with my own hand; and, gentlemen,
each one of you is more than a match for me, and
a younger man beside.”</p>

<p>“Your Majesty has reason to boast of your
prowess,” returned St. Arnaud, while Gavin, suddenly
remembering that he must act up to his character
as an officer, said with the utmost naturalness:</p>

<p>“Sire, if only I had kept my wits about me, I
would have knocked your Majesty down and
jumped out of the window. But I never spoke
with a king before, and I was so taken aback&mdash;faith!
a baby might have captured me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t try the window, my fine fellow,” said
Frederick gayly, but with a warning note in his
voice; “you do not suppose I am here without any
escort? The fact is, however, I did not think there
was a Frenchman or an Austrian in a hundred
miles. What is your name and rank?” to St.
Arnaud.</p>

<p class="p2b">“Captain St. Arnaud, of the regiment of
Dufour, and this is Sublieutenant Hamilton”
(which he pronounced no better than Gavin) “of
my regiment. We have been running away from
you ever since Rosbach, and now, presto! you catch
us like a couple of chickens in a barnyard.”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“And I broke up your little evening party with
this lady. I suspected her of being a spy, but she
charmed me so with her music and dancing that I
forgot to ask her a word, and gave her the only
thing of value I had about me&mdash;my snuff-box.
But I must let my staff know that, single-handed,
I captured a couple of tall Frenchmen.” Then
calling loudly in his clear, musical voice “Steiner!”
a young officer opened the door as quickly
as if he had sprung from the ground. When he
saw St. Arnaud and Gavin he started with amazement.</p>

<p>“Taken with my own hand,” said Frederick
with a wave of his arm. “My compliments to the
chief and the other gentlemen of my staff, and say
I will not rejoin them to-night, but I shall be
ready to start at daylight in the morning, and to
keep a good lookout. There may be more than two
Frenchmen about. You, Steiner, I will have to
attend me; and keep the others well off in the
other part of the house. We may have a little
music while the rest are having their pipes and
beer. And bring my writing-desk with you; I
shall have work to do presently.”</p>

<p>Steiner disappeared, and Madame Ziska, St.
Arnaud, and Gavin, as if realizing that they were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>in the presence of the greatest king of his age,
remained silent and standing.</p>

<p>“Pray be seated,” said Frederick, with the
charming manner he possessed, but did not always
use. “It is not often I have either leisure or
pleasure&mdash;the business of being a king requires a
man to work like a galley-slave&mdash;but to-night I will
indulge myself. I will imagine myself as I was
twenty years ago, when, so far from fighting the
French, I loved all that was French. Come, Madame,
one more song.”</p>

<p>Madame Ziska rose, and going to the harpsichord,
sang a little French chansonnette. Frederick
seemed delighted with it. As he truly said, it was
as if he had gone back twenty years, when music
and literature made up his life, and the future
great captain was the gentle and studious Crown
Prince.</p>

<p>“And he sings,” said Madame Ziska, pointing
to St. Arnaud as she rose.</p>

<p>In obedience to a look from Frederick, St. Arnaud
went to the harpsichord and sang; and then
it was Steiner’s turn, who roared out a German
drinking song. Unlike the rest, Steiner was not
at his ease before his King, although he tried hard
to assume the air of unembarrassed gayety which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>prevailed among the rest. But it was not a great
success. He knew the King too well to suppose
that the graceful abandon of any evening spent in
unexpectedly novel and agreeable company was a
fair sample of his usual moods and methods. The
rest, though, naturally pleased themselves with the
notion that they would be extremely favoured by
the King. Madame Ziska had already received
a valuable mark of his good-will in the silver snuff-box,
and expected to be sent rejoicing upon her
journey. Gavin’s visions were so brilliant that he
almost came to regard their capture as a lucky accident.
He kept thinking to himself: “Yesterday
I was a private soldier. To-night I sit with a
king. Surely, that means a turn of good fortune.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud, who knew more of kings than any
of them, was not so sanguine, but even he would
rather have been taken prisoner by Frederick than
any other man in the Prussian army.</p>

<p>The evening passed delightfully. Frederick
seemed to return to his early love for the French,
and nothing could exceed the grace of his allusions
to “my brother of France,” French literature, art,
and all that pertained to them. The extent and
variety of his information were extraordinary, and
the charm of his voice and manner could not have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>been excelled. Gavin had the good sense to remain
in the background; Madame Ziska’s manner, of respect,
without obsequiousness, was as perfect as St.
Arnaud’s, who had learned many things at courts.
At last one o’clock came. The King, looking at
his watch, rose, and Madame Ziska, immediately
taking the hint, left the room. The King said: “It
is time to go to work,” and Steiner picked up the
writing-desk and prepared to move. “The worst
of pleasant things is their ending. This room is
yours gentlemen, for the night; and, as you see,
you will have company outside the window and in
the corridors. And I am prepared to accept your
parole.”</p>

<p>An awkward silence ensued. Both Gavin and
St. Arnaud remembered at the same moment that
Gavin, not being an officer, was not entitled to his
parole; while there were so few Prussian officers,
if any, in the hands of the French, that St. Arnaud’s
exchange would be a matter of time and difficulty.
After a moment he said, with a profound
bow:</p>

<p>“I am much indebted to your Majesty, but I
prefer to take my chances as a prisoner of war.”</p>

<p>Gavin, who had determined to do as St. Arnaud
did, bowed and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“Sire, so do I.”</p>

<p>Frederick scowled&mdash;kings are easily offended,
even when they play at Haroun al-Raschid&mdash;and
then said coldly:</p>

<p>“I shall then refer you to my chief of staff. I
am under obligations to you for a pleasant evening.
Good-night.” And he walked out, obsequiously
preceded by Steiner.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud and Gavin were left alone. They had,
however, seen a soldier standing in the corridor
upon which the room opened, and outside they
heard the steady tramp of the sentry’s feet upon the
frozen snow, as he marched up and down. The
candles were burnt to their sockets, and the darkness
was only illumined by the red glow of the
stove. In silence they wrapped themselves in their
pelisses, and lay down, not to sleep, but to discuss
in whispers their chances.</p>

<p>“Why did you not accept your parole?” whispered
Gavin.</p>

<p>“Because I believed our chances better as prisoners
of war, and, besides, there was a question as
to your parole. All this may be known some day,”
replied St. Arnaud in the same low whisper.
“And you forget&mdash;Madame Ziska. No doubt we
will be carried to Glatz, and she will be taken with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>us that far. I do not fear a very strict imprisonment&mdash;and
a woman can contrive wonderful
things.”</p>

<p>“Some women can, like my mother, for example,”
replied Gavin.</p>

<p>“Very well. Madame Ziska is a loyal and devoted
woman&mdash;something assures me of that; and,
after all, we are not more than three hundred miles
from Prince Charles at this very moment. Go to
sleep.”</p>

<p>Gavin remained quiet for five minutes. Then he
whispered:</p>

<p>“Have you any money?”</p>

<p>“Only a little, but half of it is yours.”</p>

<p>Gavin nudged St. Arnaud with his elbow as a
sign of gratitude, and was again quiet for five minutes,
when he murmured: “We are much better
off, even as prisoners, than we were last night.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And,” again whispered Gavin diffidently,
“how did I act the officer?”</p>

<p>“Admirably. All you needed was a sword.”</p>

<p>“I can capture one from the enemy in time.
Do you think His Majesty will be as pleasant to
us in the morning?”</p>

<p>“Not if he is like the kings I have known. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>more friendly and companionable the night before,
the more surly the next morning&mdash;to keep us from
presuming, I suppose.”</p>

<p>A silence followed, and the deep and heavy
breathing, which showed they had laid aside all
their perplexities for that night.</p>

<p>About half an hour afterward, so Gavin imagined,
he was awakened by St. Arnaud stirring
about the room, but it was nearly daybreak. Like
a true soldier, Gavin waked with all his wits about
him. He saw St. Arnaud, after lighting a candle,
produce a kettle from the closet in which they had
been shut up, and, filling it with water, he put it
on the stove, which was still glowing hot. As soon
as the water boiled St. Arnaud, again going to the
closet, fished out a basin, and proceeded to enjoy
a thorough bath. He then produced his silver-mounted
razor and, standing before a mirror, removed
the beard which had appeared upon his face
during the last twenty-four hours. Then, completely
washed and shaved, he looked ready for a
promenade in Paris. Gavin watched him closely,
thinking to himself:</p>

<p>“He will see that I bathe and shave as carefully
as he.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud’s toilet finished, he shook Gavin, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>got up and made rather ostentatiously a toilet, if
anything, more careful than St. Arnaud’s. When
it was over the two men were perfect pictures of
officer-like neatness. And as for good looks, St.
Arnaud was exquisitely handsome, while Gavin,
by his noble figure, his brilliant complexion, and
his frank and winning expression, made up for his
want of regular beauty.</p>

<p>The tread of the sentry outside of the window
was still heard, and men were passing back and
forth in the corridors, and up and down the stairs.
Scarcely was the gray dawn visible when their
door was unceremoniously opened, and a trooper
appeared, and, pointing with his sword toward the
hall, St. Arnaud and Gavin went out. Awaiting
them they found some bread and coffee for breakfast,
and the Prussians fared no better.</p>

<p>On what had once been a well-kept pleasure
ground, with a fish-pond in the middle, the King’s
staff and escort were assembled&mdash;over two hundred
mounted men. A trooper held the bridles of the
prisoners’ horses, and Madame Ziska’s comfortable
travelling calash was drawn up in the centre of the
cavalcade.</p>

<p>In another moment Madame Ziska appeared,
a Prussian officer leading her down the steps.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>She nodded to St. Arnaud and Gavin, saying
gayly:</p>

<p>“I know not where we are going, but, being
captives to His Majesty, we will neither starve
nor freeze, of which there was great danger yesterday.”</p>

<p>Down the steps presently came Frederick. He
wore the shabby surtout of the night before, and his
hat was a captain’s cocked hat, with a tarnished
silver buckle. His face was pale and his eyes
heavy, as if he had spent the night awake. Behind
him walked poor Steiner, carrying a large bundle
of dispatches, and almost yawning in the King’s
face from sleeplessness. Immediately the King’s
horse was brought, and he mounted. His staff assembled
around him, and the order was given to
start. All this time he had not bestowed a word
or a look upon Madame Ziska in her calash or the
two prisoners. On passing them, however, he
recognized their salutes by an absent-minded bow.
Gavin, who was totally unprepared for this change,
muttered to St. Arnaud:</p>

<p>“Nice behaviour, that; I suppose His Majesty
has quite forgotten that he pulled me out of the
closet last night, and he laughed like a schoolboy at
it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“Put not your trust in princes,” was St. Arnaud’s
whispered reply.</p>

<p>They then put forward rapidly and in silence.
The morning was clear and cold, and they traveled
fast. Shortly after sunrise they reached a
place where the highroad branched in two. A
halt was made, and Frederick, who had been riding
ahead, stopped, and a part of the escort defiled
before him. When Madame Ziska’s calash approached,
behind which rode St. Arnaud and Gavin,
Frederick rode up to them. His eyes were sparkling,
his figure was erect, and the agreeable voice
for which he was celebrated rang out musically.</p>

<p>“We part here, madame and messieurs,” he
said. “Gentlemen, you are for Glatz. Madame
for anywhere she likes. I to meet Prince Charles
of Lorraine wherever I can find him. I have to
thank you for a pleasant evening. <i>Bon jour!</i>”
And putting spurs to his horse, and followed by a
dozen officers, he was gone.</p>

<p>“What strange creatures are kings!” was Gavin’s
comment to St. Arnaud, who, in his time, had
seen much of royalty. “Glatz! A terrible place
to be imprisoned in!”</p>

<p>“There is a way out of every place to which
there is a way in,” was St. Arnaud’s reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>That night they stopped at a village where Prussians
were much in evidence; and three days afterward,
at nightfall, they found themselves at the
main entrance of the fortress of Glatz.</p>

<p>Madame Ziska was still with them, but her behaviour
during their three days of journeying had
surprised and disgusted Gavin. She seemed rather
to avoid them, and was hand and glove with the
Prussians. Gavin had mentioned it several times
to St. Arnaud, who only smiled and said: “Women
go by contraries sometimes, my lad.”</p>

<p>When the moment came, before the gate of the
citadel of Glatz, that the two were to part from
her, she stepped from her carriage lightly, and
said good-by with a gayety which seemed to Gavin
quite heartless. It was a bright moonlight evening,
and the lights in the town shone cheerfully.
But before them loomed the fortress, black and
forbidding. For the first time Gavin’s heart sank;
it sank lower still when this woman, whom he had
credited with the utmost generosity of heart,
showed such indifference to their fate.</p>

<p>“I will remain here a day or two,” she said,
“until I can get post-horses. I wish I could do
something for you; perhaps I may be able to send
you some delicacies for your table. We may hope
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>to meet again; I, an actress, singer, and dancer,
go up and down the world earning my living, and
I meet everybody in the world at least once, and
sometimes twice. I shall not soon forget that evening
we spent as the King’s prisoners. Remember
me. Adieu.”</p>

<p>The two prisoners were taken before the commandant
of the fortress, General Kollnitz, who received
them courteously as prisoners of war, and
invited them to supper with him. He was of unwieldy
bulk, but clear-eyed and clear-headed, and,
evidently, a capable man. The only other guest
at the table was the adjutant, Pfels, whom St. Arnaud
and Gavin found an amiable and soldierly
young man.</p>

<p>Gavin by that time had grown so used to sitting
at the table with officers, that he felt not only as
if he really were an officer, but as if he had always
been an officer. He could not rally, however, from
his depression. The falsity, as he thought, of Madame
Ziska affected him strangely. Naturally, he
took his mother as the standard of all women, and
he looked for high courage and unswerving loyalty
from them all. True, they had no claim on Madame
Ziska, but he thought her a brave and honest
woman, and St. Arnaud had hinted at chances of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>assistance from her which had impressed the idea
upon him that they might look to her for succour.
So he ate his supper silently, while St. Arnaud
spared no pains in making himself agreeable to
the commandant. He told the story of their capture
inimitably, and had the fat general and the slim
adjutant both laughing at it, especially at Gavin’s
assertion that if only he had kept his wits about
him he would have knocked the King down.</p>

<p>At last, supper being over, they were shown two
communicating cells high up in the tower of the
fortress. A candle was given them, the door
locked, and they were left alone. St. Arnaud at
once blew out the candle, hid it, and the two, sitting
on Gavin’s bed, with the moonlight streaming
through a narrow, barred window, realized that
they were prisoners. And in the very first hour
of their real captivity they began to plan for
their escape. Gavin’s first words were: “You
counted on Madame Ziska; what think you now?”</p>

<p>“I think,” responded St. Arnaud, with a smile,
“that an honest woman like her is more to be
trusted than the great ones of earth. Look at our
friend the King&mdash;singing and drinking with us at
night, parting from us in the morning, without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>asking us if we were in want, or if he could do the
smallest thing for us.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Madame Ziska offered to send us
something to eat if she had time and could remember
it. And she hardly spoke to us after we started
on the journey.”</p>

<p>“Did you expect her to set all eyes to watching
us by promising us eternal friendship? Now hear
me: Madame Ziska’s manner convinced me that
she meant to help us substantially; and her coldness
to us was intended to throw the rest off the
scent. I can tell you this much: I shall very carefully
examine any provender that Madame Ziska
may chance to remember to send us. I knew a
woman once who sent a jewel in an orange. They
are, after all, much cleverer than we. Think about
that until you go to sleep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first week of captivity passed slowly and
heavily for Gavin and St. Arnaud, and it was not
lightened when, a few days after, came the news
of the defeat of Prince Charles at Leuthen by
Frederick of Prussia.</p>

<p>Naturally, every waking hour was spent in planning
and dreaming of escape, but St. Arnaud counselled
patience.</p>

<p>“Wait until we know something more of our
surroundings and the people about us. I have an
idea in my mind about the commandant. And,
besides, we shall hear from Madame Ziska in time,
and I have the greatest confidence in that woman’s
friendship.” To all of which Gavin gave a grumbling
assent.</p>

<p>In that time, St. Arnaud and Gavin, who, a
month before, had never exchanged a word, came to
know each other better than they knew any other
men in the world. Gavin’s trustful and generous
nature was filled with admiration at the calmness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>and even gayety with which St. Arnaud bore his
misfortunes. He made a careful toilet every day,
sang and whistled cheerfully, and amused himself
and Gavin, too, by supplying what he called the
deficiencies of a limited education. He studied
German industriously, and succeeded in borrowing
from the commandant a few old books on military
science, which he read with diligence if not with
profit.</p>

<p>“You see,” he said to Gavin, “I was taught no
end of Latin and Greek and music and grammar
and fencing, and all sorts of things that an officer
should know; but this original person, the King
of Prussia, has made all these things perfectly
useless. Some of our generals whom he has defeated
knew more Latin and Greek and fencing
than I; but yet they were whipped. However, if
England, your country, will continue to assist the
Empress Queen, we may yet beat Frederick. And
meanwhile I am doing my best to study the art of
war, although, according to the books, the King’s
tactics are all wrong.”</p>

<p>Gavin would smile at this and listen, but left
to himself, he had not the calm fortitude of the
older man. Nothing in the way of danger or privation
could quench Gavin’s spirit as long as he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>was on horseback and roaming about the country;
but the confinement of a prison for a week did more
to depress him than a month of dangers and hazards.
Often he would toss about on his narrow
bed and groan loudly in the very anguish of his
heart, and then be shamed into fortitude by St.
Arnaud laughing at him. And St. Arnaud declined
to consider either of them the most unfortunate
of men.</p>

<p>“I grant you,” said he, “that I would rather
be at Versailles, as I was a year ago, than shut up
here in Glatz. But the other was an imprisonment,
too. What do you think of getting up at
five o’clock, spending the whole day in attendance
on the King, in court clothes and periwig? Ah!
how hot it was in summer, and how cold it was
in winter! Never a moment to sit down, always
wearing a grin, when one would much rather have
scowled. I was freer when I was a captain in Dufour’s
regiment than ever I was in the King’s
Musketeers, where even the private soldiers are
gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“But we will <i>never</i> get out. Prince Charles
beaten, what is there to keep that long-nosed Frederick
from marching to Vienna? Tell me that, I say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t trouble yourself about that. Let us see
how we can get to Vienna ourselves. It is time we
were hearing from Madame Ziska, for I am sure
she has not forgotten us.”</p>

<p>The very next morning a parcel was brought
them, with an unsealed letter. All had been
opened and the letter read. It ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Captain St. Arnaud</span>: Knowing you
and your fellow-prisoner, Sublieutenant Hamilton,
were well fed by the excellent commandant,
I had difficulty in thinking of something
you needed. But remembering how excessively
particular you are about your toilet, I send
you some powder and scented soap. I am leaving
here to-day in hopes of some time reaching Vienna,
where I expect to find an engagement at the opera
house. I shall stop a few days on the road with
some relatives of mine, honest shopkeepers. How
strange is life! One day I sup with the greatest
king in the world; the next I visit people who hang
a bag of wool in one window and a hank of yarn in
the other, to signify what they have to sell. I
scorn, as you see, the common affectation of representing
my family to be more important than it
really is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>“I beg you both to hold me in remembrance,
and I promise not to forget you. We shall meet
again.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Rosa Ziska.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>The soap bore evident marks of having been
pricked through with darning-needles, to make
sure that neither files nor money were concealed
inside. Nevertheless, as soon as they were locked
up for the night Gavin and St. Arnaud proceeded
to dissolve the soap in a basin of water by the
light of the brilliant moon, which flooded their cells
through the narrow window. They were rewarded
by finding small scraps of paper, so cunningly laid
inside the soap that a needle could pass through
it without trouble. After carefully saving every
scrap and drying them all, daylight revealed them
to be, when pieced together, a bank-note for a hundred
ducats and a map of the country around
Glatz, showing, in particular, the road to the Bohemian
mountains. Several villages on the route
were marked by crosses, indicating it was safe to
stop at them.</p>

<p>“And I thought she had forgotten us!” said
Gavin remorsefully.</p>

<p>“Women, my dear boy, rarely desert us in misfortune.
They carefully choose our time of prosperity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
to play the deuce. They are considerate
even in tormenting us. One thing is sure about
this particular woman, Madame Ziska&mdash;she thinks
us a couple of enterprising fellows, and evidently
expects us to escape, and I cannot bear to disappoint
the expectations of a lady.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said Gavin, “that for prisoners
captured by the King’s own hand we have
very little attention shown us by the commandant.
He might have asked us to dinner, at least.”</p>

<p>The very next morning Pfels, the tall, thin adjutant,
appeared with the compliments of General
Kollnitz and an invitation to dinner at four
o’clock. Pfels, who was a very civil, pleasant fellow,
explained that this would have been done
before, but that the commandant had been suffering
from rheumatism, and had been obliged to keep
his bed for some time past. His health, however,
was now restored.</p>

<p>The invitation was promptly accepted, and then
Gavin began to tease St. Arnaud to tell him the
plan of escape in which the commandant figured.
St. Arnaud good-naturedly refused, and then Gavin
cried:</p>

<p>“But let us swear never to be divided from each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>other, for I believe our chance of safety is increased
tenfold by being together.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud smiled; he read Gavin like a book,
and saw that this pretense of finding safety together
was only the heart of Gavin clinging to what
it loved.</p>

<p>Precisely at a quarter to four Pfels appeared,
and led them through a maze of corridors, stairs,
and passages, to the commandant’s quarters.
These were a handsome suite of rooms, directly
on the sallyport.</p>

<p>On entering, they found General Kollnitz seated
in a huge chair; he managed to rise from it, in
spite of his vast bulk and stiff joints, to welcome
his guests.</p>

<p>“You will find us a small party,” said he, “but
the fact is we are very short of officers at present,
the King having need of all that could be spared,
and my military family is much reduced.”</p>

<p>Dinner was soon announced, and proved an excellent
one. St. Arnaud exerted himself, as usual,
to be agreeable, and he never failed at that. Gavin,
too, recovered his spirits at the sight of a good dinner,
and sent the fat general into roars of laughter
by saying, when Frederick’s name was mentioned:</p>

<p>“And to think I should have been led, like a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>great calf, out of that closet! Oh, I am afraid the
King thinks me a wretched coward!”</p>

<p>The dinner passed pleasantly, and Gavin’s heart
was made glad by a polite offer from General Kollnitz
to forward letters for them. Gavin immediately
began in thought a letter to his mother.</p>

<p>Evidences of vigilance and watchfulness on the
part of the garrison were not wanting, even when
the commandant and his adjutant were supposed
to be taking their ease at dinner. Every hour
Pfels was called into the anteroom to receive
reports from every quarter of the fortress. About
half-past eight o’clock the general, who had been
talking gayly, suddenly stopped, laid his head back,
and in a moment was slumbering peacefully.
Pfels smiled and said: “That has been his habit for
years. He is quite unconscious of it, though, and if
you hint he has been asleep he grows very angry.
He wakes of himself in a half hour or so, and goes
back to what he was talking about when he dropped
off. I was warned, when I was ordered here, that
more aides had been sent back to their regiments
for mentioning to the general that he had fallen
asleep than one could count. It is quite the garrison
joke.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, as Pfels said, the general waked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>after a while and resumed: “Gentlemen, as we
were saying a moment ago, your letters should be
ready to-morrow.” None of the young men as
much as smiled.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock the rumbling of a carriage under
the archway was heard.</p>

<p>“That is no new arrival,” remarked General
Kollnitz. “The regulations require me to make
the circuit of the fortress, inside and out, at nine
o’clock every evening. My disabilities compel me
to make the outer circuit in a carriage. But, let
none think that the only inspection had is that of a
gouty old gentleman, the rattling of whose carriage
may be heard a mile off. That is merely
perfunctory. Better legs and eyes than mine are
on watch day and night. Not a prisoner has escaped
since I have been here, and every deserter
has been recaptured. On all three sides of the
fortress a heavy siege-gun is kept loaded, and as
soon as a prisoner or deserter is missed, those guns
are fired, one immediately after the other. That
gives notice, and arouses not only the garrison,
but the town and the surrounding country. As I
offer a handsome reward for every prisoner or
deserter captured, the peasants and townspeople
may be relied on for vigilance; and difficult as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>escape is from the fortress, the real obstruction
is outside and beyond the walls. I tell you this for
your profit, because, being young and adventurous,
you may tempt fate; and you will certainly fail
unless you can get at least two hours’ start before
your absence is discovered.”</p>

<p>Pfels then went to a press in the room, and took
out a huge cloak and chapeau, which he placed
upon the general; and, putting on his own cloak
and hat, and calling an orderly to show the guests
the way back to their cells, opened the door and
carefully escorted the rheumatic old gentleman
down a winding stair. Gavin and St. Arnaud
heard the clank of muskets as the guard presented
arms, and in another moment the carriage rolled
under the sallyport.</p>

<p>The next day Gavin spent writing to his mother.
He covered many pages, and when Pfels made his
rounds that evening handed him the letter. It
was well written and well expressed, and Gavin
felt decidedly proud of his educational accomplishments.
Pfels made a polite apology for being compelled
to read the letter before sending it.</p>

<p>“Read it now,” cried Gavin.</p>

<p>Pfels glanced over it, and handed it back with a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>“Pardon me for calling your attention to a singular
circumstance; you have not told your mother
one word about yourself, as far as I have seen; it
is all about your fellow-prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Gavin with a blush. “Give me
the letter,” and he added at the bottom: “Dear
mother, forgive me for forgetting to tell you that
I am very well. Your devoted son, G. H.”</p>

<p>So agreeable was the impression made by the
two upon the commandant, that they were invited
to dine with him constantly. Life in the fortress
was monotonous to the officers, and the presence of
interesting prisoners was a genuine resource
to the commandant and Pfels. St. Arnaud and
Gavin had by no means given up the thought of
escape, in spite of the general’s well-meant warning;
and as the prospect of exchange grew fainter,
they dwelt the more upon the idea of getting away.
Both of them realized the numerous difficulties
they would encounter, even if they should be fortunate
enough to get beyond the walls; yet that
did not cause them to give up their hopes. One
night, after they had been dining with the commandant
and Pfels, and were returned to their
cells, St. Arnaud whispered:</p>

<p>“Do you know, Gavin, I think you look something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
like the general. Of course, you are not so
large, but a couple of pillows, and the general’s
cloak and hat&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What!” replied Gavin, in an indignant whisper;
for this young man had no small opinion of
his own comeliness of face and figure; and then
suddenly stopping, he realized a hidden meaning
in St. Arnaud’s words. The two conversed half the
night in whispers; and when, toward morning, they
dropped off asleep, St. Arnaud was saying: “All’s
fair in war, as in love.”</p>

<p>They anxiously awaited another invitation to
dine, and when the invitation and the day came
they were ready for something more than a dinner
with the general and Pfels. St. Arnaud had given
Gavin half the money he had left; poor Gavin had
only a few francs of his private’s pay remaining.
Gavin carried the bank-note concealed about him,
and St. Arnaud the map. Each had in his pocket
his comb and soap and such poor preparations as
could be made for flight; and each, on leaving the
cell, gave a last look back, and knew that he would
never enter it again, for before nine o’clock they
meant to make a dash for liberty, and if they failed
and were brought back, they would be consigned to
a far more rigorous confinement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>General Kollnitz received them with his usual
kindness, and Gavin felt a qualm at the thought
of the perplexity and chagrin in which they were
about to plunge the old gentleman. Liberty, however,
was too dear to be forsworn; and they both
knew it to be their duty, as well as their right, to
make every effort to restore their services to their
own country. Thoughts of the same kind had
passed through St. Arnaud’s brain, and he had said
to Gavin the night before:</p>

<p>“Our oath obliges us to do all in our power to
annoy the enemy. Egad, we will annoy the enemy
fearfully in this case&mdash;poor, dear old Kollnitz! I
believe he will be more annoyed at having his
record broken than at the loss of our valuable
company; that is, if&mdash;” St. Arnaud made a significant
pause.</p>

<p>Neither he nor Gavin indicated by the flutter
of an eyelash that a moment of destiny was approaching.
The short January twilight made
candles necessary before dinner was half over,
and then a heavy fog crept down the mountains,
and enveloped town and fortress in a white
and death-like mist. The ground was covered
with snow, and General Kollnitz shivered as he
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“Ugh! To take my rheumatism out a night
like this!”</p>

<p>By what seemed a strange fatality the conversation
turned on escapes from prison, and the general
said frankly: “I pride myself not on the
strength of my bolts and bars, but on the inability
of an escaped prisoner or deserter to get beyond
the radius in which he is sure to be captured. I
believe it has been proved that human ingenuity
can break through any bond which human ingenuity
can devise. But under my system every
peasant within ten miles is made a scout the instant
the guns are fired; and the prospect of a hundred
florins sharpens their wits amazingly.”</p>

<p>Gavin and St. Arnaud frankly agreed with him
that the real difficulties existed outside rather than
inside the prison.</p>

<p>Dinner over, the servants left the room, and
pipes were produced; but St. Arnaud and Gavin
had not acquired the practice of smoking, common
even then among Prussian officers. General Kollnitz
was a picture as he sat back, his huge form
filling his chair, with a long pipe in front of him.
Pfels was no less active and vigilant than ever;
at six, seven, and eight o’clock he went into the
anteroom to receive the report of the officer of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>guard, and at nine he was to make the tour of the
fortress with the commandant.</p>

<p>By eight o’clock the commandant was taking
his usual doze. Pfels went out into the anteroom,
and as soon as his back was turned Gavin rose
and, taking a knife from the table, softly cut all
the cords from the curtains and bell-ropes, and
quickly rolled them into a pile, which he threw on
the sofa, and carefully placed the sofa-cushions
over them. Then he gently tried the handle of the
closet door in which the general’s huge pelisse
and hat and Pfels’ hat and cloak were kept, and,
to his joy, all were hanging in their accustomed
places. When Pfels returned he found St. Arnaud
and Gavin still seated at the table, and apparently
absorbed in a game of patience, while the commandant
snored loudly.</p>

<p>“The commandant’s practice of going to sleep
over his pipe is rather awkward with certain
guests,” said Pfels, laughing and reseating himself
at the table, “but nothing can change his habit.
Luckily, I keep wide-awake enough for two.”</p>

<p>“We don’t object in the least to the commandant’s
taking his ease, although we enjoy his company;
but I observe, unlike most inert men, he
keeps other people’s eyes open.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>The three young men continued to converse
pleasantly until the hand of the clock pointed to
ten minutes before nine. Then Gavin rose and,
going to the window which was at Pfels’ back,
peered out. The solid mass of the fortress, the
town, the river, the snow-covered earth, all were
wrapped in a white veil of fog, through which they
loomed mysteriously. This cold and silvery mist
brought with it silence as well as obscurity. All
sounds were deadened, and the dim figures of the
sentries, as they passed to and fro, were like ghosts,
so noiseless were their steps. The thought came
into Gavin’s mind, “The guns will not carry far
to-night.” At that moment there was the slight
commotion outside of relieving the guard, and
Pfels said to St. Arnaud:</p>

<p>“My work for the day will soon be over. Bohm
is officer in charge to-night, and I always feel
particularly safe when he&mdash;”</p>

<p>The next instant Gavin pinioned him from behind,
and St. Arnaud slipped a gag made of the
playing-cards and a napkin into the poor adjutant’s
mouth. He had not a moment to cry out, and
could not utter an articulate sound; and the slight
scuffle he was able to make, while his hands and
feet were securely tied with bell cords by St. Arnaud,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
could not be heard outside the room. He
was then blindfolded with a napkin, St. Arnaud
saying:</p>

<p>“Sorry, dear Pfels, but, you know, it is a soldier’s
duty to escape if he can, and you would do
as much by me. You are one of the best fellows
in the world”&mdash;here he fixed the gag more firmly
in the mouth of poor Pfels, who groaned faintly&mdash;“and
as you and the general often told us getting
out of the fortress was nothing&mdash;we were certain
to be caught within two hours&mdash;so, now, we
will have a chance to test our respective theories.”</p>

<p>Pfels could only writhe about and wag his head
violently; but they thought it as well to tie him to
his chair, a precaution which they also took with
the general, as he slumbered peacefully.</p>

<p>All was done in an almost inconceivably short
time. They dared not turn the lock of the door for
fear of awaking suspicion in the anteroom, but
as no one would enter without knocking, they could
safely count on a few minutes of time. St. Arnaud
noiselessly opened the door of the press and got
out the general’s best cloak and chapeau, while
Gavin firmly tied a couple of sofa-pillows around
his body; and when he had on the huge cloak, with
the collar turned up to his eyes, and the chapeau
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>pulled down over his ears, it was not a bad imitation
of the general’s grotesque figure. St. Arnaud
put on Pfels’ cloak and hat, and they looked at
the clock and saw that they had yet five minutes to
wait.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud went to the door of the anteroom,
and kept his hand on the key, ready to turn it at a
moment’s notice, while Gavin carried out the last
detail of their carefully studied plan by stuffing
bits of his handkerchief in the ears of Pfels and the
commandant. They had then four minutes to wait
for the carriage, and it was the longest interval of
time that either one was ever to spend in his life.</p>

<p>The roll of the carriage was then heard, and in
another moment they had softly opened the door
that led to the stairs, and were going lightly down.</p>

<p>They came down so much quicker than the commandant
usually did, that the orderly, who was
standing on the pavement a little way off, did not
have time to open the carriage door; St. Arnaud,
however, saved him the trouble, and, as he ran forward,
Pfels, as he thought, was just stepping into
the carriage. The orderly put up the steps,
jumped on the box, and the coachman drove
through the sallyport, the orderly giving the countersign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> were soon across the drawbridge and
outside the ramparts. The night was pitch dark, but
in spite of it the coachman drove rapidly along the
well-known road, and they were not stopped once
after getting outside. As soon as they were on
the side of the citadel opposite the town, they knew
they were on the side of the Bohemian mountains.
This was their point of escape. Gavin disengaged
himself of his pillows and threw the heavy cloak
over his arm, and St. Arnaud did likewise; they
could not afford to cast away such excellent
disguises. Then, noiselessly opening the carriage
door, they both dropped to the ground with so
much dexterity that they managed to shut the door,
so its banging might not attract the orderly’s
attention. They thus found themselves outside the
fortress within fifteen minutes of the time they
had escaped. They stopped and listened for
a moment, but evidently no alarm had yet been
given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>“We shall hear the guns, though, as soon as
the carriage reaches the postern gate, if not before;
and after that&mdash;” said St. Arnaud.</p>

<p>Gavin only pointed before them. “Yonder are
the mountains. We cannot see them&mdash;so much the
better&mdash;no one can see us. The frontier is twenty
English miles away, and we should gain it before
daylight.”</p>

<p>With the blood leaping in their veins at the
thought of liberty, even for an hour, they plunged
forward through the fog. The snow made walking
difficult, but they felt as light of foot as the
chamois among the hills. They sped along in spite
of every obstacle, and when, within half an hour, the
report of the three alarm guns rumbled through the
heavy air, they had already gained a considerable
distance. The darkness and the fog made it
impossible for them to know precisely in what
direction they were going; they only knew that they had
got among fields and hedgerows, which they
ardently hoped were in the direction of the
mountains. Gavin, however, in the long marches of the
past campaign had got something of the soldier’s
instinct for the right road, and when toward midnight
the fog lifted and a pallid moon came forth,
they found they were on the right track for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>mountains, although they had not come as straight
as they had hoped.</p>

<p>At intervals they had heard faint and distant
sounds indicating pursuit; but the damp air stifled
sound. At midnight, though, when it suddenly
cleared, they heard afar off the tramping of hoofs.
They found themselves on a by-road, where there
were hedges, but no trees, and farmhouses were
scattered about. All was as still as death except
for that light but ominous echo of advancing
horses and men. The sound was coming nearer,
and the hoof-beats could be distinctly heard.</p>

<p>In front of them was a farmstead, with good
outbuildings, including a cattle shed and stables.
The snow was much trodden thereabouts, so that
their tracks would not betray them. They found
both the shed and the stable doors locked, but the
stable window was left open for ventilation. They
crawled in the window, and found a ladder leading
to the loft, which was stored with hay. In two
minutes they were concealed under it. In ten
minutes more a squad of cavalry had ridden up, and
every farmhouse was astir with the news they
brought. Two prisoners had escaped, and the
commandant would pay a hundred florins for either of
them. The stable door was flung open, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>farmer who owned the place and his two sons saddled
the horses, arranging their plans in full hearing
of the fugitives just above their heads. The
business of the squad of cavalry was to arouse the
country, rather than personally hunt for the
fugitives. They soon passed on, therefore, and in a
little while most of the men in the hamlet had
joined in the search, while the rest returned to bed.</p>

<p>The hay in the loft was warm and dry, and Gavin
and St. Arnaud were terribly fatigued, and
they longed to take rest until morning; but the
hours of darkness were precious to them. They
waited until everything had quieted down, and then,
starting forth from their hiding-place, resumed the
march toward the mountains.</p>

<p>They trudged along, somewhat guided by their
map, and although they caught sight more than
once of pursuing parties, they managed to conceal
themselves, but they knew they could not expect to
be so fortunate in broad daylight.</p>

<p>The dawn came clear and beautiful, and bearing
no trace of the fog of the night before. The Bohemian
mountains, only ten English miles away, loomed
darkly beautiful on the horizon. The snow lay
deep upon the whole earth when the first golden
shafts of light struck the mountain tops from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>east; as the sun rose in glory, they glowed milk
white against a sky all blue and gold and rose-coloured.
Gavin and St. Arnaud saw the exquisite
sunrise with heavy hearts; a clear day made the
chances of their eluding pursuit for ten miles still
more hazardous. They were half dead with fatigue,
after their weeks of close confinement; they
were foot-sore and hungry, but their spirits were
unfaltering, and no word of complaint escaped
them.</p>

<p>They had avoided the highway, although they
knew that every lane, by-road, and hedgerow would
be searched for them; and as the day fully broke,
they found themselves in a pleasant rolling country,
somewhat off the usual line of travel, with many
houses of a good class, but barren of woods. Immediately
before them was a pleasant villa, with a
tall yew hedge all around it. As they trudged past
they noticed a kind of natural alcove in the hedge,
in which they were tolerably concealed from view;
and they threw themselves down for a moment
to rest their weary limbs and study their rude
map.</p>

<p>Soon they heard merry voices and laughter on
the other side of the hedge. Two milkmaids were
at their work, and as the milk foamed into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>pails they laughed and chatted about the events
of the night before.</p>

<p>“Such a night!” cried one. “Troopers all over
the place at one o’clock in the morning; and Miss
Hein screamed so loud when the officer caught her
in her curl papers that he thought she had certainly
concealed the two prisoners in the house.”</p>

<p>“How sorry I am to have missed it!” replied the
other one. “This place is so dull, nothing
happening from one week’s end to another, that I
even like the notion of being routed out as you were
last night. The truth is, I don’t fancy living with
these quiet, prim ladies, like Miss Hein. I would
rather live in a large family, with plenty of servants,
and gay doings below stairs.”</p>

<p>Gavin peeped through an opening in the hedge.
The milkmaid plunged into a description of the
adventures of the night before, when the house
and offices had been searched for the two fugitives;
and in the excitement of her tale she stopped milking.
Her back and that of her companion was
toward Gavin, and the milk bucket was just within
reach of his arm. He noiselessly thrust his arm
through the opening and, reaching the milk pail,
raised it as high as he could, and St. Arnaud, tiptoeing
over the hedge, took it. There was about a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>quart of milk in it, and first St. Arnaud taking a
pull at it, and then Gavin, it was emptied in a
minute. Gavin’s long arm then replaced it, and
they resumed their places of concealment. A
shriek of dismay presently informed them that the
milkmaid had found her bucket empty. The cow
having strayed off, too, there was great excitement
for a while, but both the women moved away from
the hedge, marvelling the while over the strange
disappearance of the milk.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud, turning to Gavin, said: “We shall
be caught before twelve o’clock if we attempt to
make across the country in this clear weather.
This place has been searched once, and is not likely
to be searched again. I believe our best chance is
to remain here.”</p>

<p>“How?” asked Gavin.</p>

<p>“I will show you, if you will have confidence in
me.”</p>

<p>A look was Gavin’s only answer to this.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud then, with Gavin, made his way boldly
to the front door of the house and knocked loudly.
Another maid opened the door, and from the smirk
she wore, she, too, thought it rather amusing to
have a sensation occasionally as they had had the
night before. But there was no smirk upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>face of Miss Hein, a tall, thin, lugubrious-looking
lady, with a not unkind face, who appeared behind
her.</p>

<p>“Madam,” said St. Arnaud to Miss Hein, with
a low bow, “I hear that you were very much disturbed
last night by the searching of your house
for two runaways from the fortress. I have come
to make you every apology. We are officers, as you
see. The officer last night was a mere subaltern,
and, although zealous, he evidently did not know
how to perform an unpleasant duty.”</p>

<p>“He certainly did not,” replied Miss Hein
tartly.</p>

<p>“Ah, madam,” cried St. Arnaud sentimentally,
“would that I had come in the first instance! I
would not have disturbed you in the least. Any
complaint you have to make about the officer or
men I will attend to with pleasure.”</p>

<p>Miss Hein, whose placid house had been the
scene of such unusual turmoil, was immensely
pleased at the different tone that this supposed
Prussian officer took with her, and bowing politely,
invited them to enter. “And as you have probably
been all night searching for the fugitives, you must
be both tired and hungry, and I will have breakfast
for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>Gavin could hardly restrain a shout of joy.</p>

<p>Miss Hein took them into a comfortable sitting-room
on the first floor, and while waiting for breakfast
to be prepared St. Arnaud made such good
use of his time and tongue that the poor lady was
completely won over. He begged that she would
give them the honour of her presence while they
breakfasted, which she graciously did. St. Arnaud
asked if handbills had yet reached them
describing the escaped prisoners, and with a deep
feeling of joy heard they had not. At this Gavin
said for the benefit of the servant waiting on them,
as well as Miss Hein:</p>

<p>“I can tell you what they are like. St. Arnaud
is a great big, red-headed fellow with a terrible
squint&mdash;you would know the man to be a rascal
anywhere. His manners are harsh, and his voice
is like sawing wood with a dull saw.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud, determined not to be outdone, broke
in: “And the other one, Hamilton by name, would
be taken for a girl dressed up in man’s clothes&mdash;a
weak, puling creature, and universally considered
the ugliest man in the French army.”</p>

<p>“Do you hear that, Martha?” said Miss Hein to
the maid. “Remember it and tell the other servants.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>A good breakfast had very much raised the spirits
of the two fugitives, but they realized that they
were in jeopardy every moment. St. Arnaud,
after reflecting a moment, said to Miss Hein:
“Would it be asking too much of your kindness
to let a couple of tired Prussian officers sleep a
few hours in your house? We have been travelling
all night&mdash;I will explain later why we have no
horses&mdash;and we are overcome with fatigue.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied Miss Hein, who had been
completely won by her amiable guests. “I myself
am leaving in my travelling chaise this afternoon,
to pay a visit of some days in the town of Glatz,
and I will take you both with pleasure. The chaise
seats four. Meanwhile, you may take your rest in
an upper chamber. I am glad to show hospitality
to officers who know so well how to treat a helpless
woman.”</p>

<p>They were shown upstairs into a comfortable
room with two beds. As they shut and locked the
door, they looked earnestly at each other. St. Arnaud,
without a word, tumbled into one of the beds,
saying: “We may never come out of this room
alive; but let us take our rest calmly. We are in
the hands of fate.”</p>

<p>“In the hands of God, you mean&mdash;so my mother
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>taught me,” answered Gavin; and straightway he
plumped down on his knees at the side of the bed,
and said a prayer out aloud for their success in
escaping; and then, throwing himself on the bed,
was asleep in two minutes.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud waked first. There was a clock in
the room, and he saw that it was five o’clock, and
the short winter twilight was coming on. He shook
Gavin, and in a few moments they went downstairs.
Miss Hein, in her riding-dress, was walking
up and down the hall impatiently. “I am
afraid,” she said, “it is too late to make our
start.”</p>

<p>“That is unfortunate,” responded St. Arnaud.
“Would you, however, permit us to use your chaise
to the next posting-house, which cannot be more
than two miles away?”</p>

<p>Miss Hein cogitated for a moment. But there
was a sweet persuasiveness in St. Arnaud’s tone
that she had not been able to resist since the first
hour she met him, and she answered pleasantly:</p>

<p>“Yes. You have been so polite&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, madam, it is you&mdash;it is your kindness&mdash;and
trust me, it will never be forgotten.”</p>

<p>The chaise was before the door, and Gavin and
St. Arnaud, bidding an adieu so warm that it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>brought the blood to Miss Hein’s faded cheek,
went out and entered the carriage. The coachman,
a country lout, drove off in the direction of Glatz.
As soon as they were out of sight of the house,
St Arnaud put his head out of the window and
said:</p>

<p>“You are going in the wrong direction. It is
the next posting-house toward the mountains that
we wish to reach.” The rustic turned his horses
about, and they travelled toward the mountains
for four miles. They were too intent upon listening
for pursuit and surprise to speak much, but
Gavin said: “It is not often that escaped prisoners
ride in coaches and chaises, as we have done.”</p>

<p>“Good Miss Hein!” cried St. Arnaud. “I had
half a mind to throw ourselves on her mercy. I
believe there is scarcely a woman who lives who
will not be kind to an unfortunate.”</p>

<p>At the next posting-house they had no trouble in
securing horses, Miss Hein’s chaise and servants
being well known. The postmaster and all the
people were asking about the fugitives, and several
detachments of soldiers had visited the place that
day. St. Arnaud, talking with the postmaster,
carelessly asked if descriptive handbills had been
posted yet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>“We are expecting them every moment,” replied
the man.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud then gave a personal description
which could not possibly apply to either himself or
Gavin; and, asking for a private room, wrote Miss
Hein a note full of gratitude, to which he signed
a German name. The chaise they had ordered soon
appeared, and in a little while they were travelling
toward the frontier.</p>

<p>When night fell they were entering a little mountain
village marked with a cross on their map;
and, driving through the steep and straggling
street, they came to a shop with a bag of wool
hanging in one window and a hank of yarn in the
other.</p>

<p>They knocked, and were asked to enter by a
pleasant-faced woman. The house was a kind of
a rude inn, as well as shop and dwelling, and half
a dozen peasants were gathered around a fire
on which a pot was boiling. St. Arnaud spoke two
words&mdash;“Madame Ziska”&mdash;in the woman’s ear,
and she responded by an intelligent look.</p>

<p>“This is no place for your honours,” she
said; “I have a little room off that I can give
you.”</p>

<p>She led them into a small room, scarcely more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>than a shed, and shut the door. “I have change
for a hundred ducats,” she whispered. “My
cousin&mdash;for so Madame Ziska is, although I am not
fit to be her waiting-maid&mdash;told me to give you that
much money out of my savings, and you would give
me a bank-note for it.”</p>

<p>They quickly made the exchange, and both
eagerly asked for news of Madame Ziska, but there
was none since she had passed through the village
on her way to Vienna.</p>

<p>Supper was presently served&mdash;the first meal St.
Arnaud and Gavin had eaten in liberty since the
first night of their meeting. They were waited on
by a tall, handsome, intelligent-looking girl, Bettina,
the niece of the hostess. She took them for
Prussian officers, and showed them the utmost ill-will.
She nearly knocked Gavin’s head off with
a platter when he turned to ask her some simple
question, and scowled blackly at St. Arnaud when
he airily threw her a kiss. They were in uproariously
high spirits, although they kept their voices
down as much as possible.</p>

<p>“This is magnificent,” cried St. Arnaud, ladling
cabbage soup into his mouth. “I have altogether
lost my taste for pâté de foie gras and champagne,
in favor of cabbage soup and onions, bacon, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>black bread. They are the real luxuries of life.”
To which Gavin agreed.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud then turned his attention to the
sulky Bettina. “What a great stroke it would be
if you capture those two fellows escaped from
Glatz! You would get two hundred florins.” No
reply from Bettina, except a furious clattering of
dishes. “You could get married with that portion,”
continued St. Arnaud.</p>

<p>“Not unless I meet some men who are a vast improvement
on those who come here,” retaliated
Bettina, flouncing out angrily.</p>

<p>Presently the woman of the house entered and,
after refusing to take any money for their entertainment,
said: “You will find outside a cart and
horse. They belong to me, so you may do as you
like with them.” She showed them a way out without
passing through the front part of the house,
and there, in the moonlight, was a rough country
cart, and Bettina sitting in it to drive them. But
what a change was in her! Eager, smiling, and
obliging, she could do nothing at first but apologize
for her rudeness. “I did not know you were Madame
Ziska’s friends,” she protested a dozen times.</p>

<p>They mounted into the cart, and with thanks
that came from the bottom of their hearts parted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>with their friend. They travelled on through the
night, Bettina driving rapidly and skilfully. The
moon sank, and then came the ghastly hour between
night and day, and presently a sunrise more glorious
than they had ever seen, for they were at
liberty and in safety.</p>

<p>Bettina was to leave them at a small village
across the frontier, where they hoped to get horses,
but were far from certain. Hearing them discuss
this, Bettina said: “If you like, you can buy this
horse and cart. My aunt has been trying to sell
them both for forty florins this month past; she
wants to buy better ones.”</p>

<p>“Here are fifty florins,” joyfully cried St. Arnaud.
“But how will you get back home?”</p>

<p>“I can walk,” nonchalantly replied Bettina,
“and if I get tired on the way, I will wait for
the carrier’s cart, which goes to my village to-day.”</p>

<p>She got down in the road, St. Arnaud handed
her the money, and she made him promise to feed
the horse well; and then St. Arnaud, proceeding,
by way of reward, to give her a kiss, Bettina raised
her strong arm and fetched him a thundering box
on the ear; and Gavin, who was standing by quite
innocent, inadvertently happening to laugh, Bettina<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
gave him two corresponding slaps that nearly
knocked him down, crying:</p>

<p>“Is that the way you behave? I’ll teach you
better manners, both of you!” and she strode down the
road indignantly, scorning to look back.</p>

<p>“I thought,” said Gavin, rubbing his tingling
cheeks, “that women were always kind to the unfortunate.”</p>

<p>“Well, there are exceptions,” diplomatically replied
St. Arnaud. “For my own part, I am very
much obliged to the young lady for not giving me a
good beating; she is perfectly capable of it, physically
as well as morally.”</p>

<p>“And we are not unfortunate any longer,”
cried Gavin, jumping into the cart, and giving the
patient horse a whack. “We are free, we have
money, we have this equipage!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied St. Arnaud gayly, “we will not
trouble with post-chaises; we will travel the whole
distance to Vienna in this blessed cart; we will
make our <i>entrée</i> as conspicuously as possible. We
will drive under the palace windows of the Empress
Queen herself, and let her see us. Oh, we
will make such an arrival into Vienna that it won’t
be forgotten in a hurry!”</p>

<p>“We will! We will!” shouted Gavin, belabouring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
in the excess of his joy, the poor horse; “and
we won’t say anything about the fond adieu we had
from Miss Bettina.”</p>

<p>Some weeks after this, on a brilliant winter
morning, the last day of the year, all Vienna was
astir for a great military review. The Empress
Queen, undaunted by the disasters at Rosbach and
Leuthen, had determined to renew the contest with
her old enemy, the King of Prussia, at the earliest
practicable moment; and to give heart to her army
and people, she appeared constantly before them,
reviewed her troops often, and showed undiminished
confidence in them. She had, it is true, consented
that her brother-in-law, the Archduke
Charles, should be relieved of the command of the
army, in deference to the popular will. But she,
the most loyal sovereign in the world to all who
had served her, took occasion to soften the blow to
the Archduke Charles by appearing with him in
public and treating him with a kindness that his
courage and devotion merited, although he had
been vanquished by the superior genius of the King
of Prussia. She had, therefore, ordered a grand
review of the household troops, with a number of
veterans of the last campaign. It was a means she
took of keeping up the courage of her people,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>as well as complimenting a loyal but unfortunate
servant. When her enemies thought her nearest
to ruin, then it was that Maria Theresa showed
herself so superior to fear that she infused her own
high courage into her army and her people. And for
this reason, when her military fortunes were low,
she chose rather to act as if disasters were mere
mishaps, to be redeemed in another campaign.</p>

<p>The Viennese, who love pageants better than
any other people in the world, were out early to
see the spectacle, which did not begin until ten
o’clock. Scarcely had the sun tipped the glorious
tower of the cathedral of St. Stephen, and blazoned
the long lines of windows in the Imperial Palace
until they shone like molten gold, before the streets
were thronged with citizens and people from the
surrounding country. The Empress Queen had
selected the broad and splendid plaza in front
of the Imperial Palace from which to view the
march past, and the multitudes poured toward the
Stadt, through the narrow and tortuous streets
which lead to this region of palaces, museums, and
churches. The morning was clear, mild, and beautiful,
and the gay Viennese had apparently forgotten
the dreadful day of Rosbach and the terrible
hours of Leuthen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>The sunny air resounded with martial music and
the steady tread of marching feet of men and iron-shod
hoofs of horses. Splendid coaches bearing
ambassadors and ambassadresses rolled majestically
through the streets. Great officers of state, resplendent
in their orders and decorations, leaving their
chariots wedged in the eager, curious, and noisy
throng, made their way on foot to the palace doors.
Military officers in glittering uniforms, with gorgeous
horse trappings, dashed about on their spirited
chargers. A blare of trumpets on the one
hand was answered by the quick music of a military
band on the other, and the air vibrated with
the continuous clang of the fife and drum. It
was the day of glory of the brave army, which,
though defeated, stood ready to renew the conflict
with its old enemy at the first signal. As the
morning hours sped on toward ten o’clock the enthusiasm
of the crowds increased. The prospect
of seeing their Empress Queen in state always put
the Viennese in a good humour, and the multitudes
that packed the streets leading toward the palace
were full of merriment and in the notion to be
pleased with everything.</p>

<p>The approach of the troops was heralded with
cheers that seemed to come from miles away, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>followed them to the point where the head of the
first column debouched before the palace. At the
same moment a fanfare of silver trumpets from
the trumpeters of the guard announced that the
Empress Queen had left the palace. The great
gates were thrown wide open, and the Imperial
body-guard rode forth. This was a magnificent
battalion of men, all mounted on coal-black horses,
and wearing brass helmets and cuirasses that glittered
in the dazzling light. After them came the
Hungarian contingent, a people between whom and
Maria Theresa a peculiar bond of affection subsisted.
The people greeted these with imitations
of the peculiarly wild and piercing cries of their
country. Next rode the young archdukes, handsome
lads, and superbly mounted. Last, appeared
the Empress Queen, mounted upon a noble, iron-gray
charger, with the Emperor Francis on her
right and the Archduke Charles on her left.</p>

<p>Maria Theresa never looked more royal and imperial
than when on horseback. She rode with exquisite
grace, and her stately mien fitly indicated her
brave spirit. Although then past her first youth
and the mother of many children, she was still the
most graceful princess in Europe; and maturity
had not robbed her of her natural comeliness. Her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>eyes still shone with star-like brightness, and the
colour mounted beautifully to her cheek when, after
a moment’s sudden checking of noise, a roar of
joyous cheering, of wild hand-clapping, and of military
music clashed heavenward. She had then ridden
briskly out upon the open space, where, under
the splendid standards of the Empire, she bowed
right and left, with an enchanting smile. Maria
Theresa loved to be with her people, and was as
happy to show herself to them as they were pleased
to see her. The Emperor Francis, a handsome
man of middle age, and his brother, the Archduke
Charles, came in for their share of applause, and
acknowledged it gracefully. But the Empress
Queen had been for twenty years the darling of
the people, and her husband and children were
loved and applauded chiefly because they were hers.</p>

<p>The march past then began. First came a splendid
body of cavalry, hussars, cuirassiers, and dragoons.
The Hungarian contingent, led by their
hetmans, was gorgeously picturesque, and as they
waved their swords and lances in the air with wild
grace the Empress Queen responded with a charming
inclination of the heard. Maria Theresa had
not forgotten that in her most perilous hour the loyalty
of the Hungarians had saved her throne and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>country from the rapacity of Frederick. Next
came the foot regiments, sturdy men who had withstood
the shock of battle, and whose stained and
tattered battle-flags showed what service they had
seen. The field artillery, then a great novelty in
warfare, followed, their long, bronze guns, cast
with the Empress Queen’s crown and cipher in the
metal, gleaming dully in the sunlight. So brilliant
was the spectacle, that the hours sped away, and it
was long after noon when the end of the last column
appeared in view.</p>

<p>Among those watching it, in the crowd of diplomats,
was a slight but singularly high-bred looking
man, evidently an Englishman. He sat in a plain
but handsome coach, magnificently horsed. All
who saw the parade and the outburst of affectionate
loyalty toward the Empress Queen were affected
to a certain degree by it except this English gentleman.
He, however, regarded it all with a cool
smile, and did not speak except to make some disparaging
remark to an officer in an English uniform
who sat on horseback next the coach.</p>

<p>As the end of the columns drew near there was a
new and sudden outburst of cheering heard afar off,
mixed with laughter; the multitudes of people had
evidently seen something to both please and amuse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>them. It was so noticeable that the Archduke
Charles sent an aide riding down the line, who
came back smiling. He approached the Empress
Queen and the Emperor, and said something which
caused them both to smile, too. At the same moment
the last detachment of troops was passing,
and directly behind them came a country cart,
drawn by a sorry horse. On a plank laid across the
cart sat Gavin Hamilton, driving. He still wore
the enormous chapeau and cloak of General Kollnitz.
The huge hat was pushed back, showing his
handsome bronzed face, his white teeth gleaming
in a perpetual smile; while he awkwardly held up
the huge cloak in handling the coarse rope reins.</p>

<p>Sitting in solitary magnificence in the body of
the cart was St. Arnaud, dressed in Pfels’ hat and
cloak. He sat flat, with his shapely legs stretched
stiffly out before him, and, in contrast to Gavin’s
boyish grins of delight, St. Arnaud was as perfectly
grave and composed as if in attendance upon royalty.
The crowds had found out who they were, and
shouts resounded, and cries were bandied about.</p>

<p>“There they are, in the disguise they escaped
in! They say that Frederick was so angry when
he heard of their getting away that he burst a
blood-vessel!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>“And poor old Kollnitz took to his bed with
chagrin, and has never left it since!” called out
another.</p>

<p>The English gentleman turned to the officer on
horseback and said:</p>

<p>“What children are these Viennese! Because a
couple of officers make a clever escape, and appear
riding in a cart, these childish people go wild with
delight. Depend upon it, it is neither the escape
nor the men who matter&mdash;it is the cart and horse
which pleases them.”</p>

<p>“You scarcely do the Viennese justice, Sir Gavin,”
replied the officer, standing up in his stirrups
to look as the cart approached. “I recognise young
St. Arnaud of Dufour’s regiment as the officer
sitting down; but who is the younger one&mdash;evidently
St. Arnaud’s junior&mdash;who is driving?”</p>

<p>Sir Gavin Hamilton stood up in the coach and
looked attentively at the cart, which was then passing
the royal party. Gavin brought the horse to
a standstill, stood up, as did St. Arnaud, and both
respectfully saluted the Empress Queen.</p>

<p>“That younger man,” said Sir Gavin, with the
utmost nonchalance, “is my son. He is not my
heir, however.”</p>

<p>The officer uttered an exclamation of surprise,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>but Sir Gavin’s face remained quite impassive.
No one but the officer heard him, and the next
moment there was a general movement of the privileged
bystanders as the royal party turned toward
the palace. Then an aide-de-camp rode up to the
cart, and after a few words St. Arnaud and Gavin
descended, and an orderly led the equipage away.</p>

<p>Gavin and St. Arnaud followed the aide, Captain
Count Derschau, into the courtyard of the
palace, and to a small door in a wing of the vast
building. Entering, he showed them the way to a
small anteroom, saying:</p>

<p>“You will remain here until Her Majesty sends
for you, which will be within half an hour;” and
courteously excusing himself, he left them.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gavin</span> and St. Arnaud remained in the little
anteroom awaiting the summons to the Empress
Queen. Gavin sat quite silent. A resolve that
had taken possession of him filled his heart as well
as his mind. He dared not mention it to St. Arnaud,
for fear of his disapproval&mdash;and Gavin loved
St. Arnaud so much that he could not bear to oppose him&mdash;but
his resolution was unshakable. St.
Arnaud, brought up in palaces and inured to royalty,
yet felt something like agitation at meeting
the celebrated woman whose courage and constancy
had withstood the greatest captain of the age, Frederick
of Prussia, for more than sixteen years. But
he, too, remained silent, and in a short half hour
the aide returned, and after leading them through
a maze of splendid corridors and noble apartments,
he showed them into a small and simply furnished
room, where the Emperor Francis sat alone.</p>

<p>The Emperor rose at once; for it was the custom
of Francis of Lorraine to observe a charming simplicity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
toward all with whom he was brought in
contact. As consort of a great and popular sovereign
in her own right, he chose rather to give her
all precedence, and took but little ostensible share
in the government. He adopted the rôle of the
husband and father only, well knowing that the
jealous and varied peoples composing the Austro-Hungarian
empire would resent any open share in
the government; and although the Empress Queen
relied much on his excellent sense and judgment,
she was herself the ruler of her people.</p>

<p>Gavin watched St. Arnaud’s way of responding
to the approaches of royalty, and followed him
closely. There could have been no better example,
as St. Arnaud, while perfectly respectful, was far
from servile. The easy affability of the Emperor
put them entirely at their ease, and in a few moments
the door opened and the Empress Queen
walked in.</p>

<p>The nearer view of Maria Theresa was still more
pleasing and impressive than seeing her at a distance.
Her commanding talents, and the lofty
dignity which she naturally acquired as a reigning
sovereign in her own right, were adorned by a
beautiful feminine softness. The woman who was
not afraid to face Frederick the Great, with his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>warrior army, was likewise gentle, considerate,
and engaging.</p>

<p>Unlike Frederick, who valued men solely for
their intellectual qualities, Maria Theresa trusted
much to the excellence of their hearts, and, consequently,
where one was feared, the other was
loved.</p>

<p>The Emperor, who scrupulously observed the
deference due his wife’s rank, rose and remained
standing until the Empress Queen had seated herself.
Then turning to St. Arnaud, as the eldest,
she said:</p>

<p>“I and the Emperor have been much pleased
to hear of the escape of you and your brother officer
from Glatz. I shall need every man who can carry
a sword in the next campaign. Will you tell us the
particulars of your capture? And meanwhile,
pray be seated.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud promptly began his relation. He
told the circumstances of Gavin and himself meeting
after Rosbach, and was careful to say that but
for that meeting he would have perished on that
November night. He then described their going
to the country house, their finding there a lady
travelling with only a servant&mdash;Madame Ziska.</p>

<p>“Madame Ziska!” cried the Empress Queen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>turning to the Emperor. “No one has told me of
this. You must know,” she added, to St. Arnaud
and Gavin, “that Madame Ziska is highly respected
here, and I selected her on account of
her good sense and discretion, as well as her accomplishments,
to teach dancing to our children.”</p>

<p>“We can testify, your Majesty, to her excellent
heart as well as her admirable mind, for it was she
who conveyed the money to us which made our
escape possible,” replied St. Arnaud.</p>

<p>He then described their evening with her, and the
sudden appearance of the King of Prussia. At
the mention of the name of her great enemy, Maria
Theresa coloured deeply. She not only opposed
Frederick as the enemy of her country, but she
resented his conduct to her as a woman; and when
that part of the narrative was reached in which
St. Arnaud described Frederick’s indifference to
their fate next day, after their evening of jolly
companionship, she smiled contemptuously.</p>

<p>But she smiled with the utmost graciousness
when St. Arnaud said:</p>

<p>“We both refused the parole offered us, because
we could not bring ourselves to accept any favour
that would prevent us from drawing our swords
in the service of your Majesty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>At this Gavin broke forth, his colour rising, his
eyes moist, and his voice ringing with emotion:</p>

<p>“But, your Majesty, although I would fight for
you to the last drop of my blood I have no sword
to draw, unless you, out of your goodness, give me
one; for I am but a private soldier. He”&mdash;pointing
to St. Arnaud&mdash;“was too generous to tell it
of me, but I was only a private in the ranks of
Dufour’s regiment, in which he was a captain. I
am a gentleman, however, and I stand up and say
to all the world I am not unworthy to wear an
officer’s sword in the army of any sovereign on
earth!”</p>

<p>Gavin suddenly choked, and turning to St. Arnaud,
cried:</p>

<p>“Tell it for me, St. Arnaud, for I cannot,” and
walked away to a window to hide his agitation.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud was somewhat disconcerted at Gavin’s
outbreak, but in response to a word of inquiry
from the Empress Queen replied:</p>

<p>“What he says is true. He is the son of Sir
Gavin Hamilton, who has ill-used him and his
mother, and this young man was forced to take
service in the ranks. But he is well educated, as
your Majesty perceives by his language, and that
he has the character and feelings of a gentleman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>is proved by his treatment of his father. For when
Sir Gavin Hamilton offered him everything, provided
he would abandon his mother, this youth
refused, and chose rather poverty and obscurity
than to cast dishonour upon his mother, who is Sir
Gavin’s true and lawful wife.”</p>

<p>The Emperor, at this, said calmly:</p>

<p>“I heard only a few moments before you entered
this room that the young man was Sir Gavin’s
son. Sir Gavin is at present in Vienna. Although
England has left the ranks of our allies to join
our enemies, yet, by mutual arrangement, citizens
of one country are not obliged to leave the other
until a fixed period. Sir Gavin has availed
himself of this provision, and even appears at
court as usual. I was told by Captain von Rosen
that when you appeared riding in the cart at the
end of the parade, Sir Gavin said to him: ‘The
younger man is my son, but not my heir.’ I determined
to inquire into the matter.”</p>

<p>Gavin, at this, came from his retreat in the window,
and cried:</p>

<p>“Sir Gavin might have said that to Baron von
Rosen, but if he ever said so much to me, I would
use my two fists on him as I did once before. For,
your Majesty, such words are a reflection on my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>mother; and no man that lives, be he my father
ten thousand times over, shall say one word against
my mother without my doing him the worst injury
I can in return for it. My mother is Lady Hamilton,
and Sir Gavin admitted it when he threatened
me with divorcing my mother, after having abandoned
her many years ago. But I defied him to do
it, and he dares not attempt it. Nor will my
mother be driven or frightened into a divorce;
for she is a brave lady, and will not do anything
that may one day impair my rights or my standing.”</p>

<p>The Empress Queen listened with shining eyes.
To no one could an appeal to the feelings be made
more safely than to Maria Theresa.</p>

<p>“How does life repeat itself!” she said.
“Here is this mother, who holds tenaciously to
her rights for her child’s sake&mdash;for I believe every
word you have told me. So do I hold on to all my
rights, when the King of Prussia would ravage
them from me, determined to transmit to my son
his heritage unimpaired. Nor is it lost on me,”
she said, turning to Gavin, with the sweetest smile&mdash;“the
son who is faithful to his mother in poverty
and obscurity, rather than to the father in
power and splendour. Therefore, you may look to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>me as a friend. You say you are a private soldier.
Captain St. Arnaud says you are anxious to be an
officer. Before this day is over you shall have a
sublieutenant’s commission in my army.”</p>

<p>Gavin stood silent, stunned by his good fortune.</p>

<p>“And,” added the Emperor, “I will give you
the sword that her Majesty deems you worthy to
wear.”</p>

<p>Going to a cabinet in the room, he unlocked it,
and revealed a number of handsome swords suitable
for various occasions. Selecting one, a light
but elegant blade, he handed it to the Empress
Queen with much grace, saying:</p>

<p>“He will value it more from your hand.”</p>

<p>The joy in Gavin’s face when, dropping upon
his knee, he received the sword from Maria
Theresa transfigured him. It meant honour, glory,
the recognition of his honourable birth&mdash;all of those
things most precious to him and which had seemed
so hopelessly far away. He kissed the hilt of the
sword reverently as he received it, but he could
not speak. He bowed low to the Emperor, and
then suddenly turning to St. Arnaud&mdash;his happiness
overcoming his usually acquired habits of
restraint&mdash;and seizing him, kissed and hugged him
violently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>This natural abandon, which would have offended
many sovereigns, touched and also amused
the Empress Queen; and when Gavin recovered
himself, and stood, blushing and appalled at his
breach of etiquette, both Maria Theresa and the
Emperor Francis were laughing heartily. The
sight of Gavin’s face, flushed and sparkling, his
mouth quivering, yet full of smiles, the boyish
dimples in his cheek showing, and his lithe, strong
body trembling with happiness, appealed to the
exquisitely human heart of Maria Theresa. She
saw in him a soul capable of the greatest devotion
to her.</p>

<p>“Your commission will be sent you to-day,
Lieutenant Hamilton,” she said, with an air of the
utmost sweetness; “and you, Captain St. Arnaud,
will have your wishes fulfilled in any way possible.”</p>

<p>Then, with a graceful bow of dismissal, she
rose from her chair. St. Arnaud, with a few appropriate
words of gratitude, bowed himself out,
followed by Gavin. But before the door closed the
Empress Queen and the Emperor heard Gavin’s
eager whisper, as he said:</p>

<p>“That noble queen and lady won’t forget us
by to-morrow morning, as the King Of Prussia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>did;” which speech by no means hurt Gavin in the
opinion of the imperial pair. Another person that
heard him was Count Derschau, who awaited them
outside the door.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud was well versed in courts, and foreseeing
that Gavin would always be saying and
doing unconventional things, he concluded to let
the imperial circle understand that the Empress
Queen and the Emperor were pleased with Gavin’s
<i>naïveté</i>&mdash;and when sovereigns are pleased, courtiers
dare not find fault. He, therefore, began to
tell, in his calm and easy manner, of Gavin’s late
behaviour, and their majesties’ reception of it, at
which Gavin blushed and Count Derschau shouted
with laughter.</p>

<p>They were then passing along a gallery from
which they could look down into a large, square
room with a polished floor, where the royal children
were assembled, with their governess, for
their dancing lesson. A couple of fiddlers were
turning up, when the door opened and in walked
Madame Ziska.</p>

<p>Gavin was like to have leaped over the railing
of the gallery in his delight and surprise at
the unexpected meeting, and St. Arnaud said at
once to Count Derschau:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>
<p>“Would it be contrary to custom if we should
speak to that lady who is entering? She is the
one who assisted us so materially in our escape.
We could not have got out without her.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” responded Count Derschau. “You
must know, monsieur, that this is a court where all
that is natural and simple prevails. Besides the
cares of empire, her Majesty has the welfare of her
ten children at heart, as much as any house mother
in her empire. The Emperor is the same; and
so, although the Imperial Court does not, as you
perceive, lack dignity, yet it is less trammelled
by etiquette than any court in Europe. It is like
one great family, of which the Empress Queen
and Emperor are mother and father to us all.”</p>

<p>Count Derschau led them down a stairway which
opened upon the dancing-room, and advancing to
the lady in charge of the royal children, presented
St. Arnaud and Gavin, with the request that they
might speak to Madame Ziska; to which she at
once agreed.</p>

<p>Madame Ziska was at the end of the large room
on her knees before the little two-year-old Archduchess
Marie Antoinette, that lovely and most
unfortunate princess, whose fair head was one day
to fall beneath the axe of the guillotine. She was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>too young to be regularly taught to dance, but Madame
Ziska, leading her by her tiny hand, and singing
softly to her, she made little steps, and laughed
in baby glee at her own performance.</p>

<p>But hearing familiar voices, Madame Ziska
turned, and flying forward, the next moment she
had grasped Gavin and St. Arnaud each by a
hand, and was laughing and crying with pleasure
at seeing them.</p>

<p>“Where should we have been without you!”
cried Gavin, squeezing her hand with rapture.</p>

<p>“In the prison at Glatz, eating our miserable
hearts out,” answered St. Arnaud. “And the
money&mdash;a hundred ducats&mdash;oh, what a fortune it
was to us!”</p>

<p>“It was nothing, if it served to release two
brave men to fight for the Empress Queen; for let
me tell you, you must be hers, body and soul, as I
am.”</p>

<p>“We are&mdash;we are. Wait until we tell you of our
interview with her Majesty just now,” replied
Gavin, with all his heart shining in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I long to speak with you,” said Madame Ziska,
“but I must now give the archdukes and archduchesses
their dancing lesson. Come to my house&mdash;in
the Teinfeltstrasse&mdash;you can easily find it&mdash;at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
five o’clock, and remain to supper with my husband,
my children, and me. We will talk all
night, that I promise you.”</p>

<p>Making a low bow to the lady in charge, Madame
Ziska then began her task, while Derschau,
with St. Arnaud and Gavin, withdrew.</p>

<p>“Madame Ziska is well known and highly respected
in Vienna, as you may judge by her being
dancing mistress to the imperial children,” said
Derschau. “She is also first dancer at the opera.
She is the wife of Count Kalenga, an Hungarian
nobleman. Ziska is only her stage name. He married
her, to the ruin of his worldly prospects. He
was disinherited by his family for it, and Madame
Ziska’s profession and her humble origin made it
impossible for her to be recognized in Viennese
society. Nevertheless, they lived very happily together
upon the small remnant of his fortune that
remained to them until about four years ago.
Kalenga, who was one of the handsomest men in
the world, became a hopeless paralytic. Madame
Ziska, who has retained, as you see, her youth and
grace, returned to the stage, and by her own exertions
maintains her husband and family, giving
Kalenga all the comforts that his sad condition requires.
The Empress Queen, who is herself the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>best of wives and mothers, determined to encourage
Madame Ziska by employing her as dancing
mistress to the imperial children. As you see,
although of humble birth, she is far superior to
most of her profession. Her husband has educated
her, and to-day she is one of the most accomplished
women in Vienna.”</p>

<p>“We know it,” replied St. Arnaud. “Her conversation
charmed the King of Prussia, and the
tender, womanly interest she took in two strangers
and prisoners showed that her sympathies were
large enough to go beyond the narrow circle of her
family.”</p>

<p>They were then arrived at the small door of the
palace by which they had entered, and Derschau
bade them a courteous farewell, after engaging
to receive the promised commission for Gavin, and
keep it until he called for it next day.</p>

<p>Five o’clock found them before the door of a
comfortable house in the Teinfeltstrasse. The door
was opened by Madame Ziska herself, who led
them to a pleasant room opening into a garden.
Through the glass they could see Count Kalenga,
muffled up, and sitting in a wheel-chair. Two
handsome boys of ten and twelve were pushing the
chair to a sheltered spot warmed by the last rays
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>of the setting sun, two younger girls leaning on
their father’s lap; he was evidently telling them a
story, to which all four were listening. The scene
touched both Gavin and St. Arnaud, who knew
the story of the man so physically afflicted, but so
blessed with the devotion of a wife and children.</p>

<p>“Derschau has told you my story and my husband’s,
I know,” said Madame Ziska good-humouredly.
“He is a pleasant fellow, but a great
gossip&mdash;everybody knows everything that Derschau
knows. But seeing my husband, even as he
is now”&mdash;she pointed to Count Kalenga, who was
being wheeled toward the house by the two boys&mdash;and
her soft eyes filled with tears, “are you surprised
that a young and tender-hearted girl should
have married him? The time came when I reproached
myself bitterly for having done it, after
I saw that it cost him his fortune and most of his
association with his equals. But if he ever regretted
it, he was too noble to let me suspect it.
And when his affliction came upon him, could I
ever do enough to show my devotion to him? Ah,
do you wonder that I try to make myself his companion
by reading, by studying&mdash;that every moment
I spend away from him I grudge? Yet it is
sweetened by the thought that I am labouring for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>him and our children. And at the opera, when the
idle young men throw me bouquets and write
verses to me, my only thought is, ‘It will make
my husband smile’&mdash;it amuses him very much;
and when I find a jewel in a bouquet I very quickly
exchange it for something to make his lot more
comfortable.” She rose while she was speaking,
and opening the door, the chair was rolled in.</p>

<p>As Madame Ziska said, a view of her husband
made it quite plain why he won the heart of a
young and impressionable girl. His countenance,
still handsome, was full of candour and intelligence,
and his figure, in spite of his dreadful affliction,
retained its military uprightness. The little girls,
Gretchen and Freda, unfastened his cloak and removed
his fur cap and gloves, while the lads, Franz
and Carl, well trained and polite, stood silent near
him, ready to be of service.</p>

<p>“You know who these friends are, Franz,” said
Madame Ziska to Count Kalenga. St. Arnaud
and Gavin shook hands cordially with Kalenga,
who greeted them with the utmost grace and kindness.
The children were then dismissed, and Madame
Ziska, drawing her chair to the fire, said:</p>

<p>“Thank heaven I do not go to the opera to-night.
We will have supper here, and you shall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>tell us all your adventures. But first, mother-like, I
must see to your comfort. Have you lodgings yet?”</p>

<p>“No, we have not thought of it yet.”</p>

<p>“The floor above us is vacant, and is reasonable
in price.”</p>

<p>“If you say so, engage it for us. We will obey
you as little Franz and Carl do.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Now tell us all&mdash;all&mdash;all.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud and Gavin, both talking at once,
plunged in and gave an account of all they had
passed through since parting at the gates of Glatz
on the moonlight night two months before. St.
Arnaud told about Bettina’s unflattering behaviour
to them at separating, and Madame Ziska
screamed with laughter, saying:</p>

<p>“I am glad my niece knows so well how to take
care of herself;” to which Count Kalenga added,
smiling:</p>

<p>“She has inherited some of my wife’s spirit, for
many times, when I was a presumptuous young
officer, and she was the object of my devotion, I
came perilously near having my ears boxed. I
think, however,” he continued, turning to Madame
Ziska with an air of affectionate deference, “that
all the women of your family have remarkable propriety
of bearing, and exact respect from all.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>
<p>Madame Ziska coloured with pleasure at this.</p>

<p>Supper was brought, and the whole party grew
merry, even Kalenga. The enthusiasm with which
the Empress Queen had filled St. Arnaud and
Gavin was deeply gratifying to their hosts, and
Gavin’s solemn promise that the sword given him
by Maria Theresa was forever at the service of her
and her family, was but a just acknowledgment of
his obligations to her.</p>

<p>“You should have seen her as I did, at Presburg,
in 1741, when she won the hearts of all
Hungarians,” said Kalenga, leaning forward in
his chair, his eyes sparkling, and his hand involuntarily
reaching for the sword, no longer at his
side, that he had worn so many years in the service
of the Empress Queen. “She was then but
twenty-four-years old, and the handsomest woman
of her time. On the day of her coronation, when
she rode gallantly up the Sacred Mount wearing
the tattered robe of St. Stephen over her splendid
habit, the iron crown of St. Stephen on her head,
and, drawing St. Stephen’s sword, defied the four
corners of the earth, she was sovereign of the
hearts of all who saw her. But greater still
was she when she entered the Hall of the Diet,
wearing the Hungarian dress, in deep mourning,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>and the same crown and sword of St. Stephen.
Never can any who lived that hour of glorious
patriotism forget it. She was the picture of
majesty, fearless and unappalled, when, standing
upon her throne, she recounted to us, the assembled
nobles of Hungary, all the dangers that
menaced her, and her sole defence lay in the
loyalty and generosity of her Hungarian people.
The King of Prussia, when he attacked her kingdom,
openly counted upon her timidity as a young
and inexperienced princess. Young and inexperienced
she was&mdash;but no man ever made so
great a mistake as Frederick when he reckoned
upon the timidity of Maria Theresa. She had
ever the courage of a hundred kings in her woman’s
heart. So did she inspire us on that never-to-be-forgotten
day, that as one man we rose, and
with shouts and cheers and clanging of our swords,
as we drew them half way from their scabbards
and sent them ringing back again, cried: ‘We will
die for our King, Maria Theresa.’ At that, the
woman’s heart, which ever dwells in her, made
itself felt. She, who had scorned fear when the
men around her trembled, and who proposed to
die rather than yield to injustice, burst into tears,
and wept before us. Oh, then we were wild&mdash;we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>wept, too&mdash;but they were tears of love and admiration
and devotion to her who was so much a queen
and yet so much a woman. And from that day to
this has she been the darling of the Hungarian
people!”</p>

<p>“And she is worthy of it!” cried St. Arnaud,
roused from his habitual calm, and speaking before
Gavin had time to take breath after Kalenga’s
recital. Madame Ziska supplemented her husband’s
glowing words by many stories of the Empress
Queen’s excellence as a wife and mother,
and Gavin and St. Arnaud were eager listeners.
Gavin was ready to believe anything of the courage
and nobility of a woman defending her rights&mdash;he
had seen an example of it in his own mother.
St. Arnaud, familiar with a corrupt court, where
evil and designing women held empire, was glad
to know that a royal and imperial lady could make
virtue fashionable and decorum popular.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Madame Ziska after a while,
“let us go upstairs and see the apartment that I
wish our landlord to let to you.”</p>

<p>Taking candles, she led them upstairs, where,
above her, was a comfortable suite of rooms to be
had. Gavin, in the impetuosity of his gratitude
and affection for Madame Ziska, would have leased
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>a dog-kennel recommended by her. St. Arnaud,
cooler and more experienced, saw that the rooms
were really desirable, and that Madame Ziska was
a good counsellor in the every-day affairs of life.
Gavin declared that he meant to stay that very
night, as they had no other lodgings, and it was not
likely the landlord would come and turn them
out. St. Arnaud laughingly agreed; Madame
Ziska abetted them by lending them sheets and
pillows, and at midnight they tumbled into bed
and slept the sleep of the just, untroubled by any
qualms as trespassers.</p>

<p>Next morning, by ten o’clock, they had engaged
the lodgings. But earlier even than that Gavin
had gone after his commission, and had received
with it a small sum of money, by way of pay, in
advance. It was modest enough, but it was more
money than Gavin had ever seen at any one time
in his life. With it he could pay back his part
of Madame Ziska’s loan and fit himself out with
clothes and uniforms. St. Arnaud could draw,
in Vienna, on his funds in Paris&mdash;so they could
establish themselves in comfort in their new quarters,
which they proceeded to do. The proudest
moment of Gavin’s life was when he stood up to
be measured for his uniform in the hussar regiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
to which he had been assigned. It was approached,
however, by the joy he felt in signing
his name to a long letter to his mother&mdash;“Your
affectionate son, Gavin Hamilton, sublieutenant in
the Jascinsky Regiment of Hussars of her Imperial
Majesty, the Empress Queen Maria Theresa.”</p>

<p>It is not often that any human being enjoys
perfect happiness, even for a single day; but for a
time it fell to Gavin Hamilton’s fortunate lot. It
is true, he felt it necessary to his credit, as well
as his happiness, that his mother should be redeemed
from her life of toil, and he ardently
longed to have her with him. This, however, he
knew to be practicable, and with his sanguine temperament,
he regarded it as already accomplished.
And so it was a time of happiness that he entered
upon at Vienna, the memory of which was a joy
to him as long as he lived. Within the week he
had completed the formalities necessary to receive
his commission, and he was to attend the Empress
Queen’s levee, to “kiss hands” upon entering
the royal service. St. Arnaud was also to go, to
pay his formal respects at court. The levee was
held in the evening, and Madame Ziska, who
danced at the opera that night, actually drove
home, in the intervals of the performance, to see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>her two friends. St. Arnaud, who had recovered
his good looks, along with regularity in having
something to eat, and fresh air and exercise, was
exquisitely handsome in his new and dazzling uniform.
Gavin, who had no regular beauty, but a
fine figure and a frank, speaking face, looked his
best in his white hussar jacket and glittering
accoutrements. No mother admiring her young
daughters dressed for their first ball could have
shown more pride and pleasure than Madame Ziska.
The children, who were allowed to stay up
as a special privilege, were in raptures of delight,
while even Kalenga, who was always patient, but
seldom gay, smiled in sympathy with the pleasure
of those around him. At last St. Arnaud and
Gavin set off in a hired coach.</p>

<p>A great crowd of notabilities filled the anterooms
of the palace, but way was made everywhere
for Gavin and St. Arnaud. Their story had been
told broadcast in Vienna, and the proudest and
most exclusive society in Europe was prepared to
welcome them. St. Arnaud was already well
known, and Gavin’s relationship to the haughty
and unpopular Sir Gavin Hamilton was public
property. St. Arnaud had remarked to Gavin,
on entering the palace:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>“Surely Sir Gavin Hamilton will absent himself
from this levee. He will not wish to be
brought face to face with you.”</p>

<p>“You little know my father,” replied Gavin.
“It is not in him to avoid anybody or anything.
This much I must say of him&mdash;he does not know
how to skulk.”</p>

<p>True as Gavin had said. As they reached the
door of the imperial apartments, Sir Gavin Hamilton,
plainly but elegantly dressed, and wearing a
diamond-hilted sword and a single splendid decoration
on his breast, barred the way. He was
conversing with the Chancellor, the celebrated
Prince Kaunitz, known as “the coach driver of
Europe,” from his superior management of affairs.
Great as Kaunitz was, he had an obtrusive
vanity, amazing in a man of so much power and
ability. In contrast to Sir Gavin Hamilton’s
studied simplicity of attire, Kaunitz was a mass
of jewels and embroidery, while the entire breast
of his blue velvet coat was covered with medals,
orders, and decorations. Sir Gavin, a single eyeglass
in his eye, surveyed the Chancellor with cool
arrogance, and even the mighty Kaunitz was impressed
by the calm assurance of the English
baronet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>Sir Gavin directly blocked the doorway, and
after waiting a few momenta, Gavin, exchanging
glances with St. Arnaud, tapped Sir Gavin on the
arm lightly, and said:</p>

<p>“Pardon, but will you kindly permit us to enter?”</p>

<p>Sir Gavin turned around, without making way
in the least, and quietly surveyed his son for a
whole minute.</p>

<p>“I asked,” said Gavin, slightly raising his
voice, “if you would kindly permit us to enter.”</p>

<p>The little scene had attracted the attention of
those near by, and it was perfectly well known
who Gavin was. Kaunitz, who heartily disliked
Sir Gavin, watched with a sly smile the outcome
of this novel encounter, and anxiously hoped for
the baronet’s discomfiture.</p>

<p>Gavin met Sir Gavin’s cold, impassive glance
with one full of a steady defiance. They were very
unlike, this father and son&mdash;Sir Gavin, small,
slight, and pale, and Gavin, tall and well developed
for his twenty years; but when they stood
face to face, defying each other, as it were, a
strange likeness came out between them&mdash;no one
could doubt then their relationship.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>
<p>After a moment more Gavin coolly unbuckled
his sword, and handing it to St. Arnaud, said:</p>

<p>“The Empress Queen gave me that sword with
her own hand; therefore, it shall touch no unworthy
thing.” And as quick as a flash he seized Sir
Gavin around the waist, and setting him aside,
as if he were a chair, or any other piece of light
furniture, walked in, followed by St. Arnaud, who
handed him his sword.</p>

<p>There was a burst of suppressed laughter, in
which Kaunitz’s delighted cackle could be heard.
Sir Gavin, pale with rage, was yet indomitable,
and looked about him with an unabashed front.
Kaunitz, whose opportunity it was, sauntered up,
smiling blandly.</p>

<p>“My dear Sir Gavin, I feel the utmost sympathy
for you. Most disrespectful of <i>your son</i>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is my son,” slowly replied Sir Gavin,
“but&mdash;”</p>

<p>Gavin, a few steps farther on, turned back, his
face as pale as his father’s.</p>

<p>“Be guarded in what you say,” he said in a
distinct voice.</p>

<p class="p2b">“But not my heir,” continued Sir Gavin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="illo4"><img src="images/i_130.jpg" width="500" alt="“HE DROPPED SIR GAVIN ON TO THE FLOWER-BED FIFTEEN FEET BELOW”"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">“HE DROPPED SIR GAVIN ON TO THE FLOWER-BED FIFTEEN FEET BELOW”</p>

<p class="p2">Gavin made one swift and silent step toward
him. Close at hand was an open window, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>out of it Gavin instantly handed Sir Gavin, holding
him carefully suspended, and dropping him
considerately upon a flower-bed fifteen feet below.</p>

<p>“I have not hurt him,” he said, turning to the
astonished spectators. “I have let him down very
softly. You see, I cannot let any one, least of all
my father, Sir Gavin Hamilton, say that of me,
because it reflects upon my mother. And I dare
not wear the sword given me by the Empress
Queen, nor even face her Majesty, if I suffer one
disrespectful word to be spoken of my mother,
Lady Hamilton.”</p>

<p>There was a ripple of applause and laughter.
All had occurred so quickly and quietly that only
those immediately around them in the vast anteroom
knew anything of what had happened. But
it spread rapidly. St. Arnaud drew Gavin away,
whose face was now deeply flushed, and who was
beginning to show agitation.</p>

<p>“I do not know whether this will be my ruin or
not with the Empress Queen,” he said in an excited
whisper to St. Arnaud; “I only know that
some force stronger than I, and better, too, than
I, impels me to defend my mother’s good name
whenever this man attacks it; and if ruin comes
because of it, let it come. Had Sir Gavin been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>standing on the very steps of the throne, I should
have done as I did.”</p>

<p>“You are quite right; you have nothing to fear.
Prince Kaunitz saw it all, and you may be sure
that the right account will get to the Emperor and
Empress Queen. So let us take our places in line
as if nothing had occurred,” counselled St. Arnaud.</p>

<p>This they proceeded to do, and in their turn
they entered the splendid apartment, where weekly
the imperial levee was held. On a daïs under
a canopy of crimson velvet sat Maria Theresa and
the Emperor Francis. The Empress Queen, in a
white gown, with a crimson velvet mantle lightly
thrown across her shoulders, wearing superb jewels,
and a small tiara on her dark hair, was a picture
of matronly beauty. No one would have suspected
that this majestic and serene woman often
spent nights of agonized weeping over her lost
armies at Rosbach and Leuthen. Misfortune
might rend her heart, but it could not shake her
lofty spirit, and she set an heroic example of hope
and courage. She was talking affably to those
about her, especially a very old man, in the dress
of an Hungarian magnate, for whom she had
caused a chair to be placed, in consideration of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>infirmities. As each person was presented she
had an appropriate word, and when St. Arnaud’s
time came, she acknowledged his respectful greeting
by saying pleasantly:</p>

<p>“I desire to hear more of your adventures in
getting out of Glatz.”</p>

<p>To Gavin she said that which gave him a thrill
of the deepest happiness.</p>

<p>“I hope, Lieutenant Hamilton, that you have
informed your mother, Lady Hamilton, of your
fortunate escape.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the winter of 1758 Vienna society
found one of its most interesting subjects of small
talk in the affairs of Sir Gavin Hamilton and his
son, Lieutenant Gavin Hamilton, of the Jascinsky
Regiment of Hussars. Of course, all sorts of variations
were given to the story, the plain, unvarnished
truth being the version seldomest heard
and least believed. Although England had withdrawn
from her alliance with the Empress Queen,
and the King of Prussia had secured an English
alliance and an English subsidy of nearly seven
hundred thousand pounds, it was the policy of
Kaunitz to treat the English in Vienna in a conciliatory
manner. There were only a few of them,
chiefly gentlemen of fortune like Sir Gavin Hamilton,
who had a fancy for what was then, next
to Paris, the gayest city of continental Europe,
and who took advantage of the permission to remain
until the actual outbreak of hostilities in the
spring. Nowhere was the spirit of resistance to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>Frederick’s aggressions so determined as in Vienna,
and it was the belief both of the great Chancellor
and his imperial mistress that it would be
well for Englishmen of rank and standing to note
the undaunted front with which the Court of Vienna
met misfortunes, and prepared to redeem them.
Sir Gavin was distinctly unpopular; but that,
which would have been a reason with most men
for leaving Vienna at the earliest feasible moment,
was reason enough to keep him there until
the last possible hour. He had an unshakable
self-possession, and it gave him a cynical amusement
to show himself when the world expected him
to take himself off; to smile and be at his ease
when other men would have been miserably ill at
ease; to calmly ignore the attitude of others when
it did not coincide with his own attitude. He appeared
punctually at the next weekly levee of the
Empress Queen, after he had been dropped out of
the window by his son, and bore with perfect composure
the sly smiles and covert gibes to which
his adventure gave rise. Only on one point did
he change. Twice had he met Gavin, and each
time the slur cast upon Lady Hamilton had been
resented in a way against which he was practically
defenceless. All the sneers and jeers in the world
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>were helpless against a young man with such fine,
powerful arms and legs as Gavin’s, and who had
no scruple whatever in using them. Sir Gavin
saw, therefore, the absolute impossibility of conveying
any slight upon Lady Hamilton in her son’s
presence without being made not only odious, but
ridiculous; and, like Gavin, he knew perfectly well
that no place and no company would give him security,
when the occasion rose, from the just resentment
of the son of the woman he had so injured.</p>

<p>Gavin, deep in learning the duties of his new
position, yet lost not a moment in trying to get
his mother to Vienna. The journey would be long
and expensive, and it would require rigid economy
for both of them to live on his hussar’s pay;
yet his affectionate heart yearned to have her with
him. Madame Ziska and her husband, and St.
Arnaud, who knew the world well, pointed out
other reasons why it was desirable that Lady Hamilton
should come to Vienna.</p>

<p>“It is your great opportunity,” said St. Arnaud
one evening when they all sat together in
Madame Ziska’s apartment. “There is no doubt
that the Empress Queen will receive your mother
as Lady Hamilton, and it will carry great weight
in your contest for your rights.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>“Especially will it be so,” added Kalenga, who
was a man of much sense, “if she is received as
Lady Hamilton while Sir Gavin Hamilton is
here. It will be plain that there could be no deception
about it, and that the Empress Queen
knew the exact status of the case. Therefore, I
recommend you to make every effort and every
sacrifice to get your mother to you at the earliest
moment. When the campaign opens in the
spring, you will be obliged to leave Vienna. You
should have her here before you are ordered
away.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said St. Arnaud, “through my connections
in France, can arrange for her to start
and have money advanced to her.”</p>

<p>“And I,” chimed in Madame Ziska, “can lend
you a few ducats to help her out.”</p>

<p>The ever-ready tears filled Gavin’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Why should I have such friends? I think
it must be my mother’s blessing that brings them.
But, oh, me! I do not know where in Paris my
mother can now be found. The last letter that
reached me was in the summer. She may have
changed her quarters since then.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” cried St. Arnaud encouragingly.
“It is not likely that she did not take steps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>to have her whereabouts known, and the King’s police
can find her, anyhow.”</p>

<p>That very night St. Arnaud wrote a packet of
letters, to be dispatched by the next post to France.
Only after they were gone did he tell Gavin that
he had directed his friends in Paris, not only
to find Lady Hamilton, but to supply her with
everything needful for her comfort in making the
long journey. More than that, he went next day
to Prince Kaunitz, and laying before him the facts
in the case, got a specific promise from him that
the Empress Queen would receive Lady Hamilton
on her arrival. And he and Gavin, in whatever
company they found themselves, took pains to announce
the coming arrival of Lady Hamilton.
The presence of Sir Gavin made a very pretty
complication, and conjecture ran riot in Vienna
society as to what he would say and do when the
catastrophe came. Sir Gavin discounted it all by
saying and doing nothing whatever. Bets were
freely made as to the date when Sir Gavin would
be driven to flight. The Chancellor, Kaunitz,
hearing it talked of one evening in the Empress
Queen’s antechamber, took a pinch of snuff, and
coolly poising it between his thumb and forefinger,
remarked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>“Sir Gavin Hamilton will remain in Vienna
as long as he is not wanted. The day we appear
to wish him to stay he will take post for Berlin
or London or the devil. Yesterday I achieved the
greatest diplomatic stroke of my career. Sir Gavin
came to see me at the Chancellery, and inquired
whether he could have permission to remain
in Vienna, if he so desired, beyond the time stipulated
in his passport. I was on the alert at once.
I knew, whatever he supposed my wishes were,
that would he not do. Therefore, I answered him
in such a manner that he did not and cannot find
out whether his presence here is pleasing or displeasing
to her Imperial Majesty’s government.
That is what I call a diplomatic triumph.”</p>

<p>And Kaunitz dramatically waved his jewelled
hand and lace-trimmed handkerchief in the air.</p>

<p>“But the wife he repudiates is coming,” suggested
a pert maid of honour. Kaunitz shook his
head.</p>

<p>“No such trifle as that, my dear lady, will move
Sir Gavin Hamilton. Englishmen are obstinate,
but Sir Gavin Hamilton has an obstinacy as tall
and as wide and as deep as the cathedral of St.
Stephen.”</p>

<p>On a snowy day in February, about the time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>that Lady Hamilton was expected, St. Arnaud sat
alone in his apartment. He was hard at work
over some details of his regiment; for the remnants
of it had been got together, and with the
new recruits it could make a tolerable showing
in numbers. Below he could hear the Kalenga
children romping&mdash;Madame Ziska was away at the
palace giving the dancing lesson to the little archdukes
and archduchesses, and Kalenga, the most
devoted of fathers, allowed his children much
more indulgence than their mother. They grew
so noisy presently that when St. Arnaud heard the
grinding of wheels before the door, he said to himself:</p>

<p>“Thank heaven, Madame Ziska is come, and
they will now be quiet.”</p>

<p>But, looking out of the window, he saw it was
not Madame Ziska who was descending from the
carriage, but a lady in black, whose slightness and
youthfulness of figure made it seem impossible
that she should be the mother of a son as old as
Gavin Hamilton.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud returned to his work, until he heard
steps ascending the stairs, and Freda’s childish
voice saying:</p>

<p>“The gentlemen are out, but I can show you to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>Lieutenant Gavin’s room&mdash;that is what we call
him.”</p>

<p>The door opened and Lady Hamilton entered.</p>

<p>The youthfulness of her figure was not fulfilled
in her face. Sorrow and want had done their work
there; they had clouded, though not destroyed her
delicate beauty. Her dark eyes were Gavin’s eyes,
but her hair, once a deep brown, was plentifully
streaked with gray. Her complexion, extremely
fair, had not the red glow of youth, and her fine,
straight features were thin and marked. But however
much she had the signs of having suffered,
she was now palpitating with joy, and her pallor
was that of overpowering emotion. Her eyes rested
upon St. Arnaud, then quickly searched the room.</p>

<p>“He is not here&mdash;my son&mdash;” she said, trembling
as she spoke.</p>

<p>“No, madam,” replied St. Arnaud, rising, “but
he will be here very shortly.”</p>

<p>Lady Hamilton advanced to the middle of the
room, and placing her hand on St. Arnaud’s arm,
said:</p>

<p>“I know well who you are&mdash;my son’s friend
and best benefactor. I am almost glad that Gavin
is not here, for I did not know how much it would
agitate me to meet him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>St. Arnaud led her tenderly to a chair, saying:</p>

<p>“Remember, you are among friends who honour
you and love Gavin.”</p>

<p>The woman, who had borne with stoical composure
for twenty years the miseries of a repudiated
wife, broke down under these words of kindness.
She laid her head upon her arms and sobbed
convulsively. Freda, with wide and frightened
childish eyes, watched her, while St. Arnaud let
her weep unchecked; he saw that it was doing her
good. Freda, who was an affectionate child, stole
her little hand in Lady Hamilton’s, and asked
earnestly:</p>

<p>“Won’t you let me get you some coffee to make
you stop crying&mdash;and a little piece of bread with
it and some cheese?”</p>

<p>Lady Hamilton drew the child to her, and smiling
through her tears, called her a dear child.
Freda thought the ways of grown people very remarkable.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Lady Hamilton recovered her
self-possession&mdash;the pains of joy are short-lived&mdash;and
sat up, her wan face glowing with happiness.
And then, just as she and St. Arnaud were talking
as if they had known each other forty years, an
eager step was heard on the stairs, and Gavin, his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>face flushed with exercise, and looking every inch
a man and a soldier in his hussar uniform, bounded
into the room. St. Arnaud slipped into his
own bedroom&mdash;the meeting between the mother
and son was too sacred for other eyes.</p>

<p>Gavin caught his mother in his arms and
strained her to his heart. Both wept&mdash;they had
shed no tears at parting&mdash;and a dozen times Gavin
cried: “Mother! my mother!” and Lady Hamilton
answered: “My son! my excellent, brave
son,” as if the mere repetition of the title each
loved gave them joy.</p>

<p>The first rapturous kisses over, mother and son
looked at each other with new eyes. When they
had parted nearly two years before, Gavin was
a boy. He had looked up to his mother for help in
every relation of life, and she had been forgetful,
as mothers are, of the development of the boy into
the man, and had yearned over him in his youth
and inexperience much as she had watched over
him in his cradle. Now, in the twinkling of an
eye, after a separation of two years, their situations
were reversed. The mother saw at one glance
that here she had a stay and prop&mdash;the days of
her comfort were beginning. And the son saw
that, in the natural evolution of events, he could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>now begin to return to his mother that all-providing
care with which she had sheltered his hard and
poverty-stricken youth. Lady Hamilton surveyed
his tall and well-formed figure with delight. She
had never before in her life seen him tolerably
well dressed. To keep him decent had taxed all
her slender resources; and to see him in all the
splendour of his white hussar uniform was a revelation
to her.</p>

<p>“I did not know you were so nearly handsome,”
she said fondly, kissing his forehead. “But I
never before saw you in the guise of a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my mother,” cried Gavin, “after I had
left you and knew something of the world, I wondered
how you, alone and forsaken in a strange
country, ever continued to live at all! And to feed
and clothe <i>me</i>&mdash;what a burden I must have been
to you!”</p>

<p>“No burden, but my only joy and hope. Tell
me, therefore, my son, have you so lived since we
parted that I can still have joy and hope in you?
Look me in the face and tell me if you have led
a clean life and an upright life, for I know you
cannot deceive my eyes, even if you would.”</p>

<p>Gavin looked at her honestly, clearly, unflinchingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>“I have not been perfect, mother,” he replied.
“No one is that, you have always told me; but
there is not one hour of my life since we parted
that you cannot know all about, if you wish to
hear it. Remember, the ways and talk of private
soldiers, of whom I was one for two years, are
not the ways and talk in which you bred me;
but these soldiers were honest, brave fellows, if
they were uncouth and coarse. I have felt, however,
much more at home in the company which
St. Arnaud made possible to me than I ever did
among the soldiers; and in one thing, at least, I
obeyed your commands”&mdash;here Gavin laughed&mdash;“I
was often ragged and always cold and hungry,
but I never was a moment without a piece of soap,
a comb, and a razor.”</p>

<p>At which Lady Hamilton smiled and said:</p>

<p>“You are my own true boy. My father and my
brothers were always clean and well-shaven, as becomes
gentlemen. I don’t know how I should feel
toward a son who neglected those things.”</p>

<p>Gavin grew serious enough the next moment,
for he said:</p>

<p>“And do you know that my&mdash;that Sir Gavin
Hamilton is in Vienna?”</p>

<p>A deep flush rose instantly in Lady Hamilton’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>pale face. Gavin went on and described his adventure
with Sir Gavin Hamilton at the imperial
palace and everything connected with him, and
especially the possibility that he and Lady Hamilton
might meet if Lady Hamilton went to the
Empress Queen’s levee, which she, no doubt,
would.</p>

<p>“And after her Majesty receives you, mother,”
cried Gavin exultingly, “Sir Gavin can no longer
insult you by saying you were not his wife.”</p>

<p>“But will her Majesty receive me?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly; so Prince Kaunitz has promised
St. Arnaud. And I have privately told St. Arnaud
that if by any accident or intrigue it is
refused, or even delayed, I will resign my commission
at once and enlist again as a private soldier.
But St. Arnaud will manage it. St. Arnaud
has a great family connection in Paris. The
Chancellor, Kaunitz, knows all about him&mdash;so
trust St. Arnaud to do for you what he has done
for me. He is the best friend with whom mortal
man was ever blessed.”</p>

<p>“I long to see him again. When I arrived I
was so overcome and agitated that I scarcely knew
what I was saying; but I loved him before I ever
saw him. And I love that good Madame Ziska&mdash;ah,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
Gavin, Gavin, how much good there is in the
world!”</p>

<p>“Come,” cried Gavin, jumping up. “I hear
the carriage at the door&mdash;Madame Ziska has returned
from the opera-house&mdash;and where is St.
Arnaud?”</p>

<p>Gavin ran in the other rooms of the apartment,
shouting:</p>

<p>“St. Arnaud! Where are you? Come and see
my mother;” but St. Arnaud was nowhere to be
found. Gavin then escorted his mother to the floor
below to meet Madame Ziska and her husband.
In all the terrible privations, humiliations, and
struggles of twenty years, Lady Hamilton had
never lost the best part of her birthright&mdash;the air
and manner of the high-bred Englishwoman.
Her black gown was shabby and her slim hands
roughened by the actual toil she had been compelled
to do, but she was everywhere at ease, with
that serene and graceful unconsciousness which is
the mark of a person born to consideration. Madame
Ziska, although born and bred in a far humbler
position in life than the English gentlewoman,
had been gifted with a natural refinement and good
sense that was equal to all the advantages of birth
and early education; so the two women, on meeting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
had every reason to be mutually satisfied with
the other.</p>

<p>Gavin very proudly introduced his mother
as “Lady Ameeltone”&mdash;for he had not yet learned
the true pronunciation of his own name&mdash;to Madame
Ziska and Count Kalenga. Lady Hamilton
took both of Madame Ziska’s hands in hers and
said earnestly:</p>

<p>“How can I thank you enough for what you
have done for my son?”</p>

<p>To which Madame Ziska replied in her more
emotional and demonstrative way:</p>

<p>“Oh, madam, he is such a nice lad! And
when I saw those two admirable young men that
freezing night when we first met, my heart went
out to them. At first they did not know whether
I was married or a widow. I believe they thought
at first I was a widow, they paid me so many gallant
compliments, and all the time I was laughing
to myself, thinking how their tone would change
if they knew I had a husband and four big children
snugly tucked away at home.”</p>

<p>“True,” cried Gavin with a grin. “We were
sure that Madame Ziska was a young widow,
she was so charming, and we felt quite flat when
we found she regarded us merely as a couple
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>of schoolboys to be helped out of a predicament.”</p>

<p>Kalenga then joined in the conversation, and
the children were brought in and presented, Freda
especially, a pretty, quaint child of thirteen, who
had already made friends with Lady Hamilton.
When Madame Ziska addressed her as Lady Hamilton,
she smiled sadly and said:</p>

<p>“A title has often seemed a mockery to me,
when I have been in so great poverty and obscurity
for so many years. But it is a part of my son’s
heritage, and that is why I hold to it.”</p>

<p>Madame Ziska, the soul of hospitality, proposed
that they should all sup together.</p>

<p>“And how vexatious it will be of St. Arnaud if
he is not here,” she said. “He must be detained
somewhere. As I do not dance to-night, we can
put off our supper until eight o’clock, and by that
time he will probably be here.”</p>

<p>The afternoon passed only too quickly, Lady
Hamilton listening to the adventures of Gavin,
and every moment feeling a deeper thankfulness
for the man he had become. She herself, accustomed
in her youth to the most refined society,
had formerly noted with regret many little things
in Gavin which it was inevitable that he should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>acquire from the humble associates of his childhood
and boyhood. But all these small faults of
manners and language seemed to have disappeared.
In two short months Gavin had become perfectly
fitted for the society to which he was born and
entitled.</p>

<p>Eight o’clock came, and Kalenga’s chair had just
been wheeled up to the comfortable supper-table,
when St. Arnaud appeared. Madame Ziska covered
him with reproaches for deserting them on
that, of all afternoons.</p>

<p>“Wait, madam,” mysteriously said St. Arnaud.
“I have not been forgetful of Lady Hamilton,
though I presume she thought I vanished into
thin air when I disappeared so suddenly. I have
been to see Prince Kaunitz at the Chancellery.
The Chancellor has been to see the Empress Queen,
and has just given me this.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud drew from his pocket an elaborately
sealed letter, with the imperial arms, addressed to
“The Lady Hamilton.” It was a letter from the
Court Chamberlain commanding the attendance of
Lady Hamilton at the next weekly levee of the Empress
Queen, on the following Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>Gavin jumped up, snapped his fingers, danced,
laughed, embraced St. Arnaud a dozen times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“Now,” he cried, “we will see what Sir Garvan
Ameeltone”&mdash;with infinite contempt&mdash;“will do
when her Majesty receives Lady Ameeltone!”</p>

<p>Lady Hamilton, more accustomed than Gavin
to the society of the great, was deeply gratified,
but not, like him, highly elated; and when he spoke
of his father in a tone that indicated so much
hatred and contempt, she flashed him a look that
reduced him to silence at once. Nevertheless,
there was no mistaking the earnest gratitude of the
few words, straight from her heart, with which she
thanked St. Arnaud. It was, indeed, a long step
toward her rights to be received by a great and
virtuous sovereign in the very presence, as it were,
of the man who had vainly tried to repudiate
her.</p>

<p>It was an evening of great happiness to them all.
Madame Ziska and Kalenga had become so attached
to Gavin and St. Arnaud that whatever
made them happy, the husband and wife shared
thoroughly. Lady Hamilton found in Kalenga
so much patience under misfortune, and so much
affection and appreciation of his wife, that she
honoured him with all her heart. When she saw
their mutual devotion, she could not but think with
vain regret: “Had Sir Gavin Hamilton so treated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>me, I should have been the happiest woman in the
world.”</p>

<p>Next morning a very great and important subject
came up, of which only Lady Hamilton and
Madame Ziska realized the true significance. This
was the gown that Lady Hamilton was to wear to
the imperial levee. Gavin tried to settle it at
once by saying:</p>

<p>“Go to the shops and buy the handsomest gown
you can find. I can pay for a part of it, and St.
Arnaud will lend me the rest.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, no,” replied his mother, smiling.
“It would not be in good taste that I should appear
handsomely dressed, even if you had the
money, which you have not. It is much better that
my dress should be as simple as circumstances will
allow. Therefore, I shall wear a plain black satin
gown. When I was presented, in my girlhood, to
the King and Queen of England, I wore a very
simple gown, for my parents were not rich people
for their station in life. I think I cannot do better
than follow their plan now, although they have
long since been taken from me.”</p>

<p>The days could not go fast enough for Gavin
between then and Tuesday. The only thing that
marred his happiness was the possibility that Sir
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>Gavin Hamilton would not be present to witness
the triumph of the woman he had so ill used and
insulted. True, Sir Gavin did not mean to be at
the levee, for he heard in due time of the arrival
of his wife, and knew that the Empress Queen
would receive her. But he had no notion of being
driven from Vienna by her presence, and sardonically
concluded that Lady Hamilton would be
as anxious to avoid him as he would be to avoid
her.</p>

<p>Tuesday evening came, and Gavin and St. Arnaud,
dressed in their court uniforms, awaited
Lady Hamilton’s appearance from her room.
With only little Freda to assist her, Lady Hamilton
was making her toilet. Presently the door
opened, and Freda, with a candle in each hand,
came out, looking solemn beyond expression, and
putting the candlesticks on the table, gazed with
grave admiration at Lady Hamilton, who followed
her.</p>

<p>Gavin caught his breath with admiration
when his mother came full into the circle of light.
He had never thought of her as a beautiful woman,
only as the dearest woman in the world. He had
seen only in her large, dark eyes the mother love
shining for him. He had only felt in her rare
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>smiles the sympathy with him that made her
smile sometimes in the midst of her hard lot. And
he had never seen her dressed except in the plainest
and, often, in the shabbiest manner.</p>

<p>But to-night she wore her simple black satin
robe with the air of a princess. For the first time
in twenty years her beautiful white neck and
handsome arms were bared to view. Her hair, silver
and black mingled, was still abundant, and
arranged with singular grace and becomingness.
At night the lines of care in her face were not
visible; pleasure, from which she had long since
parted, had again come to her, and had brought
to her cheek a flush like the glow of youth. She
wore no jewels&mdash;she had none to wear&mdash;but her
majestic and high-bred beauty needed no ornaments.</p>

<p>Gavin’s first gasp of admiration over, he was
strangely silent, while St. Arnaud, with the polished
grace of a man of the world, complimented
Lady Hamilton upon her distinguished appearance.
No woman ever loses her appreciation of
a pretty compliment, and as for Gavin, Lady
Hamilton was more touched than she would have
acknowledged by his admiration. She had asked
herself while dressing: “Will he like me in this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>guise?” as a young girl questions of her lover.
There was no doubt that Gavin liked her in that
guise; but when his mother turned to him once
more his eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, my mother,” he cried. “To think what
youth and beauty were yours when sorrow came
to you! To think that I, your child, never before
saw you except in the clothes of work and poverty!
I feel now as I never felt before the terrible hardship
of your lot.”</p>

<p>“But the worst is over,” replied Lady Hamilton;
“and remember, I always had you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, to feed and clothe; to eat up all you
could earn; to wear out the poor garments you
could afford to buy me.”</p>

<p>“At least, all you had was honestly earned.
Let us be thankful that you lived at no man’s
grudging table and wore no one’s cast-offs. That
is why, after so many years of work and poverty, we
are still able to take our stand among our equals.”</p>

<p>As Lady Hamilton spoke with so much spirit
and dignity, it occurred to St. Arnaud that the
man who could desert such a woman must be very
perverse or very bad.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud handed Lady Hamilton into the
hired carriage that was to take her and Gavin to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>the palace, saying he would follow them as soon
as he could dispose of some letters he must have
ready for the next post to Paris.</p>

<p>As Lady Hamilton and Gavin walked together
through the splendid saloons of the Imperial
Court none there showed more dignity and composure.
Lady Hamilton was the only woman present
who wore no jewels, and this absence of ornament
made her conspicuous. She was, however, well
fitted by her splendid dignity and the calm and
unruffled manner of an English gentlewoman to
stand the scrutiny of the hundreds of eyes levelled
at her. The universal verdict was the same as
St. Arnaud’s in respect to Sir Gavin Hamilton.
Gavin, resplendent in his gorgeous, white uniform,
looked about him with sparkling eyes of triumph,
which said plainly to all: “This is my mother.
Have I not a right to be proud of her?” Many
persons stopped and spoke with them while they
were finding their place in line. Among them
was Prince Kaunitz. The Chancellor ever had an
eye to grace and dignity in a woman, and within
a few minutes of being presented to Lady Hamilton
he whispered to her and Gavin:</p>

<p>“Will you do me the honour to sup at my house
after the levee?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>Lady Hamilton accepted with politeness, and
Gavin with a frank delight he could not conceal.
These little supper parties at the Chancellor’s
house were among the most agreeable and distinguished
parties in Vienna. Only a small number
of persons, more eminent for talents than rank,
and the best among the foreign visitors at Vienna,
were asked to them. To be invited once gave the
<i>entrée</i> to any of them. Gavin had never been bidden
before, and he knew very well that he was
indebted to his mother’s personal charm for being
invited at all.</p>

<p>When their turn came to be ushered into the
presence of the Empress Queen, Lady Hamilton
showed to great advantage. Unabashed by Maria
Theresa’s splendid presence, she, nevertheless, did
homage to so much greatness united with all the
attractions of a charming and lovable woman.
The Empress Queen’s first remark was to say,
with slight but unmistakable emphasis on the
words, “Lady Hamilton”:</p>

<p>“I hope, Lady Hamilton, you are pleased with
what we have been able to do for your son.”</p>

<p>“More than pleased, your Majesty,” replied
Lady Hamilton. “I am deeply and eternally
grateful both to yourself and to the Emperor.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>And if my son ever comes into his inheritance as
an English gentleman there will be one Englishman
who can never speak or think of your Majesty
except with the liveliest gratitude.”</p>

<p>“I and the Emperor were peculiarly gratified
at the refusal of your son and Captain St. Arnaud
to accept of their parole when offered it by the
King of Prussia. And the marvellous escape they
made gave us as much pleasure as it did chagrin to
the King of Prussia. These incidents of personal
daring are of great value in keeping up the spirits
of men engaged in defending us against the perpetual
assaults of Prussia.”</p>

<p>Lady Hamilton bowed deeply, and passed on.</p>

<p>It was Gavin’s turn next, and to him Maria
Theresa made one of those tactful speeches which,
coming from a sincere heart, never failed to win
the hearts of others.</p>

<p>“I have had great pleasure in meeting Lady
Hamilton. You are fortunate in having such a
mother.”</p>

<p>Gavin’s eyes shone so brightly and his face coloured
so deeply with pleasure that he was on the
point of forgetting what little court etiquette he
had learned by dropping on his knee and seizing
the Empress Queen’s hands and kissing them violently.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
Some remnant of self-control saved him,
but his air and manner indicated so much joy,
pride, and gratitude that a smile went around the
whole circle of onlookers, not even excepting
the Empress Queen and Emperor.</p>

<p>Lady Hamilton had thought that years of poverty
and obscurity would give her a dislike for the
brilliant scenes of a court levee. On the contrary,
she found herself taking pleasure in a society for
which her birth and education originally fitted her.
She was haunted, however, by a horror of Sir
Gavin Hamilton’s appearance. Great as had been
his offences toward her, he was still enough of an
object of interest to her to make her dread a possible
meeting with him. She once had loved him
well, and however deep the resentment she felt
toward him, she could never regard him as an object
of indifference. Gavin, manlike, could not
understand this. He did not seek the places where
he would find his father, but he certainly did not
avoid him. As he had never known affection for
his father, he could well be indifferent to meeting
him.</p>

<p>But to Lady Hamilton’s intense relief, Sir Gavin
did not appear at the levee that evening. This
was not from want of courage, but Sir Gavin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>realized that he would be at a hopeless disadvantage.
The sympathies of the court and society
were with his wife and son, and, besides, he felt
perfectly certain that no place or person would
restrain Gavin if Sir Gavin failed in respect to
Lady Hamilton; so Sir Gavin wisely went somewhere
else for the early part of the evening.</p>

<p>Eleven o’clock was the hour when the specially
favoured were to assemble at the Chancellor’s splendid
house. It had just struck the hour when Gavin
escorted his mother up the broad marble stairs of
the Chancellery and into a cosy little drawing-room,
where a choice company were assembled.
St. Arnaud was there before them, and in a moment
more Prince Kaunitz came in, with profuse
apologies for being later than his guests.</p>

<p>“But I really believe,” he complained, “that
the Empress Queen can work twenty-four hours
in the day, and she wishes me to do the same.
Will you believe it, in the middle of the levee she
sent me word that I must look over a batch of
dispatches, awaiting me in her closet, and I actually
fell asleep over them, as I had been at work
since six this morning. After the levee her Majesty
came into the closet and shook me with her
own hand until I waked. And, confidentially,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>I may say I did not open my eyes as soon as I
might. Then she said in the briskest tone you
can imagine: ‘Come, let us to work. We must
earn our bread.’ ‘Thank you, madam,’ I replied,
‘I cannot speak for your Majesty, but I know the
Emperor and myself have earned at least a month’s
bread by the work we have done this day.’
‘Well,’ said her Majesty, ‘I have spent more
hours than either of you in state affairs to-day,
and I have likewise given, as I always do, all the
attention necessary to the education and training
of my ten children.’ ‘The good God has spared
me the ten children, madam, but I believe if your
Majesty had twenty children to look after, you
would still do more work than the Emperor and
myself&mdash;and we are two of the most persistently
industrious men living.’ This made her Majesty
laugh, and she said: ‘Poor, good Kaunitz, go
home. I have sent the Emperor to bed, and I
alone will work at these dispatches.’ I would have
stayed at that, but she sent me away after a little.
So here I am, late, but glad to get here on any
terms.”</p>

<p>The great Chancellor was a charming host, and
when they gathered around the supper-table, a
small company of the brightest wits in Vienna,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>he infected every one present with his own gayety
and charm. He distinguished Lady Hamilton
by his attentions, and it was a small but cherished
triumph for Gavin, who counted that among the
happiest evenings of his life.</p>

<p>Supper was not over nor the guests ready to
depart until some time after midnight. Others
had come in, and the party grew merrier as the
hours flew by. As the final move was made to go,
Prince Kaunitz stood up, with a glass of champagne
in his hand, and said:</p>

<p>“Before parting, pledge with me the health of
a lady who has only lately come to adorn Vienna,
but who, we hope, will long remain with us.”</p>

<p>The Prince fixed his smiling glance upon Lady
Hamilton, who sat opposite to him. She rose, too,
but the smile froze on her lips and she turned
deadly pale at the noiseless entrance of a person
by a door directly facing her and behind Prince
Kaunitz. The Chancellor, not hearing the new
arrival, continued with much grace: “The lady
whose health I propose is Lady Gavin Hamilton.”</p>

<p>Lady Hamilton’s sudden pallor and agitation
had not escaped notice, and a slight movement on
the part of the newcomer had attracted every eye
to him. The Chancellor, still unhearing, happened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>to glance into a tall mirror over the fireplace, opposite
him, and in it he saw Sir Gavin Hamilton,
standing perfectly cool and composed, his hand on
his dress sword, and looking Lady Hamilton full
in the eye. She, blanched and trembling, yet undauntedly
returned his gaze as she stood. The
only change of attitude she made was to lay her
hand lightly upon the shoulder of Gavin, who sat
next her. But the action was eloquent. It was
as if she said, “Here is my charge and my protector
in one.”</p>

<p>Gavin’s face had turned scarlet as his mother’s
grew white. He sat quite motionless, for once not
knowing what to say or do. Many times he had
wondered what he should do when his mother and
father met, as they were likely to do at any moment
after Lady Hamilton’s arrival in Vienna,
and he had never yet hit upon any course of
action. But he had vauntingly said to himself,
“When the time comes I shall do the right thing.”
The time had come, and he sat silent and disconcerted
and feeling nothing but a furious anger and
helplessness.</p>

<p>Lady Hamilton continued to look Sir Gavin
calmly in the eye, and the pause grew momentous.
A clock ticking in the room seemed a loud
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>noise, so utter was the stillness. Seconds passed,
which seemed minutes, and as Lady Hamilton’s
glance remained fixed on Sir Gavin, they seemed
to change places. She grew courageous, and the
crimson returned to her face; while the fresh colour
left his cheeks, and he, this man of iron composure,
grew tremulous. The Chancellor, who watched it
all, and who enjoyed it from the bottom of his
heart&mdash;for Kaunitz had an elfish spirit which
made him delight in awkward <i>contretemps</i> for
others&mdash;suddenly spoke in a very cool, soft voice:
“Give Sir Gavin Hamilton a glass,” he said to
a servant. “He will join us, no doubt, in our
homage to Lady Hamilton.”</p>

<p>All there fully expected to see Sir Gavin touch
his sword as he replied to Prince Kaunitz. So,
indeed, he wished to do; but Lady Hamilton’s
steady glance held him as if by mesmeric power.
Mechanically and against his own volition he
raised the glass handed him by the servant to his
lips and drank as the others did. Then, quickly
recovering himself, he threw the costly glass on the
floor, where it crashed into a hundred pieces, and,
turning his back, walked quickly out.</p>

<p>Whatever Lady Hamilton felt, she had managed
to retain her self-possession perfectly. Not so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>Gavin. He felt dazed and disconcerted, and but
for St. Arnaud’s tactful manner of getting him
out of the room would have showed the confusion
which reigned in his soul. Prince Kaunitz himself
put Lady Hamilton into the carriage. Gavin
entered after her, and St. Arnaud, saying he
wished a breath of air before going to bed, followed
on foot.</p>

<p>Once alone in the carriage with his mother,
Gavin clasped her in his arms, saying, “How
proud I was of you! And how superior did you
appear to the wretch&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush,” replied Lady Hamilton in a strained
voice; and suddenly bursting into tears, she cried:
“He was not always like this. I cannot, cannot
think that he was always bad. He was a gallant
man and a gentleman when I married him.”</p>

<p>Gavin remained silent, amazed and confounded
at this revelation of a woman’s secret tenderness,
which could survive twenty years of neglect, persecution,
and unspeakable humiliation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning, before nine o’clock, a messenger
came from the Empress Queen to St. Arnaud,
commanding his immediate presence at the
imperial palace.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud reappeared at dusk in the evening.
Gavin was sitting by the window, listening with
amusement to the stories Lady Hamilton was telling,
in her soft, pleasant voice, to the two little
girls, Freda and Gretchen.</p>

<p>“Make ready,” said St. Arnaud to Gavin as he
came in, “to start for Breslau with me to-morrow,
at midnight, with a flag of truce to the King of
Prussia. I was sent for by the Empress Queen
for that purpose. All is settled. I was allowed
to choose a brother officer to accompany me, and
I chose you.”</p>

<p>“A thousand, thousand thanks,” cried Gavin,
who realized the advantages of being sent upon
such an expedition.</p>

<p>“I warn you, though,” continued St. Arnaud,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>warming himself by the fire, as the little girls
lighted the candles and Lady Hamilton and Gavin
hung breathless upon his words, “our mission will
fail. The King of Prussia has never been celebrated
for his kindness to the unfortunate, whether
prisoners, whom he generally browbeats, no matter
how humble or how exalted their station, or officers
of his own who do not prove always equal to victory.
The Prince of Severn, who was taken prisoner
while reconnoitring near Breslau last October,
wishes a letter conveyed to the King of Prussia,
in winter quarters at Breslau. The Prince,
you must know, being an ally of Frederick’s, fully
expected steps to be taken at once to secure his release
on parole. But so far the King of Prussia
has not written him a line, or shown the slightest
interest in the fate of one of his best friends and
generals. The poor Prince, tired with waiting,
declares there must be some misapprehension on
the King’s part, and solicited the Empress Queen
to allow him to send a letter to the King
at Breslau. She at once agreed, for she is
as kind to prisoners and considerate of their
feelings as Frederick is to the contrary. She,
therefore, from the goodness of her heart, consented
to transmit the letter, but, as it often is, there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>is sound political wisdom as well as generosity in
her action; because, if Frederick wishes to befriend
his ally, the Prince can be exchanged for
a large number of Austrian prisoners, and if his
neglect is intentional, it will place Maria Theresa’s
conduct in shining contrast to her great
enemy’s. The Emperor and Prince Kaunitz saw
this when they agreed to her generous proposal.
The Prince intimated a wish that I might be the
officer sent&mdash;I was able to show him a trifling
kindness once some years ago&mdash;and the Empress
Queen assented with the utmost alacrity. Great
and magnanimous as she is, she is woman enough
to be willing to let the King of Prussia see us,
his two prisoners, free and in good case. All arrangements
are made. I have letters and money
and horses, and we start on the stroke of midnight
to-morrow. We shall probably be gone two weeks,
but if we are caught by the spring floods, we shall
be detained until they subside, for the Empress
Queen and the King of Prussia between them have
scarcely left a bridge standing in Silesia.”</p>

<p>Gavin was overjoyed at the prospect of an expedition
of so much interest; and his mother
showed her sympathy with him by at once beginning
to talk over preparations. Gavin ran downstairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
to Madame Ziska, who was just arranging
the lamp and fire, and placing Kalenga with a
book for the evening, before going to the opera.</p>

<p>“I am charmed,” she cried, “although we shall
be lonely without you and Captain St. Arnaud.
But you will have so much to tell us when you get
back! We shall be glad to take care of Lady Hamilton
while you are away. Luckily, I do not dance
to-morrow night, so we can spend the evening together.”</p>

<p>The Empress Queen, with her usual liberality,
which sometimes exceeded her means, having provided
them with a considerable sum of money,
next day they made comfortable arrangements
for the journey. Prince Kaunitz offered them
a small but excellent travelling chaise, which,
being brought to the house, Lady Hamilton and
Madame Ziska proceeded to stock with comforts
not likely to be found on the road. By eight
o’clock their preparations were complete, and they
sat down to a merry supper in Madame Ziska’s
apartment.</p>

<p>“I shall miss you both more than I can say,”
said Lady Hamilton, “and I shall not go to the
palace or accept any invitations until you return.
But that I will not mind. I shall amuse myself,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>if Madame Ziska will permit, by teaching Freda
and Gretchen English, and so the weeks will pass
more quickly.”</p>

<p>“I shall be only too grateful,” quickly replied
Madame Ziska, who saw the advantage of her two
young daughters having the training of a woman
so highly educated and well bred as Lady Hamilton.</p>

<p>“And pray,” she continued, laughing, as they
drew up to the table, “to make my most respectful
compliments to the King of Prussia, and to tell him
that his snuff-box was treated with the highest respect
wherever I showed it, and often got me accommodations
at inns and post-houses when it
would have been otherwise impossible. Likewise
say to him, that I think my dancing has improved&mdash;the
Emperor has been pleased to say that the
ballerina of the Queen of the Naiads is the best
thing yet done at the opera.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud and Gavin faithfully promised all.</p>

<p>The evening sped rapidly away, all, even Kalenga,
being in the highest spirits. When the
clock struck twelve, and the chaise was at the door,
Kalenga, raising himself in his wheeled chair,
proposed the health of the two departing ones,
which was drank with enthusiasm. Then followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
affectionate farewells, Gavin running back
from the door for a last embrace from his mother,
and soon they were clattering off over the frozen
roadway toward the gates of the city.</p>

<p>As soon as they had passed the gates, and got
into the open country beyond, St. Arnaud, who was
an experienced traveller, settled himself to sleep;
but Gavin, who had never made a journey in a
chaise before, was too excited to sleep. He compared
his lot then&mdash;an officer with a recognized
position as a gentleman, regular, though small pay,
his mother with him, her position recognized, a
powerful friend in St. Arnaud, and other true
friends in Madame Ziska and her husband, the
protection of a great and generous sovereign like
Maria Theresa&mdash;and the contemplation of these
things caused a wave of reverential gratitude to
overwhelm his soul. A year before he had been
a private soldier, with all the hardships of a private
soldier’s lot in those times. He had been
ragged and cold and hungry; his fellow-soldiers,
brave, honest fellows though they might be, were
rude and ignorant men, of coarse manners, and
rarely could any of them read or write. He recalled
that he had not been really unhappy during
the time that he had trudged along, carrying a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>musket&mdash;in fact, it gave him something like a
shock to remember that he had begun to like the
life, and felt less and less the ambition to rise to
something better. Perhaps he would have risen
in any event, but, surely, the finding himself alone
with St. Arnaud in a freezing desert after Rosbach
was the most fortunate circumstance of his
whole life. These thoughts crowded upon his
mind, but after a while the steady motion of the
chaise made him drowsy, and he slept.</p>

<p>Seven days were they on the journey, although
they travelled as fast as the state of the country
would permit, and at noon on the seventh day they
came within sight of the towers and steeples of
Breslau, and met the Prussian outposts.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud, tying his white handkerchief to the
point of his sword, got out of the chaise, as did
Gavin, and advanced toward the Prussian sentinel.
The officer of the guard was at once sent
for, and after a very short delay they were blindfolded
and driven inside the walls and fortifications.</p>

<p>It was a tedious drive to the quarters courteously
provided for them, and both St. Arnaud and Gavin
suspected that they were being driven in a roundabout
manner, to confuse their sense of locality.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>Arrived at their quarters, the Prussian officer,
Lieutenant Bohlen, led them, into a room, and
exacting the usual promises from them that they
would not leave the house without permission and
an escort, removed the handkerchiefs from their
eyes. He then left, to report their arrival at headquarters,
after ordering dinner to be sent them.
The dinner was very good, and they were still
at it when Lieutenant Bohlen returned.</p>

<p>“The King will see you to-night after he has
supped, and meanwhile desires that you be made
comfortable.”</p>

<p>Gavin spent a good part of the afternoon making
a toilet for the King of Prussia. He bathed
and shaved, and put on clean linen from top to
toe, and his handsome white uniform and varnished
boots.</p>

<p>“And I think,” he complacently remarked to
St. Arnaud, “the King will find me a different
person from the great gaby he hauled out of the
closet. Oh, I shall never forgive myself for not
knocking him down&mdash;I could have done it so
easily.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud, too, had made an elaborate toilet,
and as he surveyed himself and Gavin, he rather
wounded Gavin’s self-love by saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“You and I are obliged to dress well. The King
of Prussia is shabbier than any captain in his
army&mdash;but&mdash;he is the King of Prussia, and he
can afford to be shabby.”</p>

<p>About eight o’clock in the evening, another
officer, Major Count von Armfeld, appeared, and
politely introducing himself as aide-de-camp to
his Majesty, requested them to go with him.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful moonlight night as the party
emerged into one of the quaintest and oldest streets
of Breslau. They were near a splendid bridge
across the Oder, and the moon shone brightly on
the placid bosom of the river. Everywhere were
the signs of military occupation. Churches had
been turned into barracks, public buildings into
arsenals, and nearly every house had officers billeted
in it.</p>

<p>After crossing the bridge, they entered a handsome
street, at the end of which was a large and
splendid mansion. A couple of sentinels were
pacing before the door.</p>

<p>“That is where his Majesty lives,” said Von
Armfeld. “It is called the King’s House. It
has a garden to it, in which the King takes exercise.”</p>

<p>Von Armfeld giving the countersign, they entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
the mansion, and ascended a handsome staircase.
The house seemed to be buzzing like a beehive,
all the rooms being lighted up, and officers
at work in them. At the end of a long corridor
was a small door, before which they stopped. Von
Armfeld gave four peculiar raps on the door; a
voice said, “Come”&mdash;and St. Arnaud and Gavin
found themselves in the presence of the great Frederick.
He was sitting by the fire and was wrapped
in an old military cape. His face was cadaverous,
his eyes sunken, and his whole appearance
so changed by ill health, that St. Arnaud and Gavin
would have had difficulty in recognizing him.
But if they found recognition of the King difficult,
the King found recognition of them impossible.
He looked at them as if he had never seen
them before, and motioning them to sit, consulted
a little memorandum before him.</p>

<p>“Captain St. Arnaud of Major-General Loudon’s
corps and companion, Sublieutenant Hamilton.
I knew General Loudon. I might have had
his services when he returned from Russia, but I
frankly admit I saw not the man of genius under
his unpromising exterior. At the blockade of
Prague, his patent as Major-General, sent him by
the Empress Queen, fell into the hands of some of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>my hussars. I had it returned to him, and was
pleased to serve so gallant an officer.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud bowed at these praises of his commander,
and after a pause Frederick said negligently:</p>

<p>“Have you the Prince of Bevern’s letter?”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud rose, and taking the Prince of
Bevern’s letter from his breast, handed it to Frederick,
with another bow. It was a long letter,
and both St. Arnaud and Gavin watched the
King closely as he read. He had a speaking face,
and as he read page after page of the letter his
countenance grew more sinister. St. Arnaud gave
Gavin a slight glance, which said plainly: “The
Prince will get no help.”</p>

<p>After reading it over carefully, Frederick laid
it down, and began to speak on the topic, apparently,
the farthest off, in more ways than one, from
Bevern’s letter that could be imagined.</p>

<p>“Did you ever study astronomy, Captain St.
Arnaud?”</p>

<p>“Considerably, your Majesty. When I was at
the College of St. Omer’s in France&mdash;for I had
some education before I joined the army&mdash;I was
much interested in it, and spent many nights at
the telescope.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“I confess, I knew very little about the science.
There is a garden communicating with the one we
have here, and in it is an observatory with a fine
telescope. I have been troubled with sleeplessness
this winter, and I have spent many hours,
in consequence, studying the planets. I have
found it singularly soothing. Nothing so reconciles
one to the chances and changes of this life
as looking through a telescope. There one sees
the infinite smallness of triumphs; the utter nothingness
of misfortunes.”</p>

<p>“True, your Majesty,” replied St. Arnaud, as
composedly as if he had come all the way from
Vienna to discuss astronomy. “Of course, the
uppermost thought in every mind is whether those
infinite worlds are inhabited or not.”</p>

<p>“It is a thought too staggering to pursue very
far. The first conception of space is noble and
exhilarating beyond expression. But I believe
that the strongest mind, fixed perpetually on the
vast possibilities of the solar system, would become
unbalanced. Astronomers do not become so, because
they pursue the science with exactness, and
do not let imagination into the matter at all. But
for persons like you and me, who look at the
myriads of worlds with the eye of speculation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>it soon ceases to be exhilarating; it becomes overwhelming,
and I, for one, dare not dwell too long
upon it. The night is clear. Will you go with me
to the observatory?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” replied St. Arnaud, without showing
the faintest surprise.</p>

<p>Frederick rose, and as he did so he fell into a
violent paroxysm of coughing. When it was over
he sank into his seat, too overcome with weakness
to stand. Annoyance was pictured on his face
at this exhibition of illness before the officers
of the Empress Queen, and also a spirit of iron
determination. His soul was ever stronger than
his body, and in this case he triumphed over illness
and exhaustion. After a few moments he rose,
and going toward the door, St. Arnaud respectfully
opened it, and he passed out. He held his hat
in his hand, but had omitted to take his cloak,
which hung over the back of his chair. St. Arnaud
had not noticed the omission, but Gavin had,
and picking the cloak up, he ran after the King,
saying, “Your Majesty would do well to take this;
the night air is sharp.”</p>

<p>Frederick, with the ghost of a smile, proceeded
to wrap himself up in the cloak, and then said:
“You may come also.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>Nothing loath, Gavin followed. Crossing a large
garden, they ascended the stairs of a moderately
tall observatory. The effort made Frederick
gasp and tremble, but his step never faltered as
he climbed up. Reaching the top, he struck his
flint and steel, and with St. Arnaud’s assistance
he lighted a large lamp, saying, “That is visible
from every part of the house, and signifies I
am in the observatory, and I am not to be disturbed.”</p>

<p>The telescope was soon arranged, and the King
and St. Arnaud were deep in astronomical surveys
and discussions. St. Arnaud was singularly
well versed in astronomy, and Frederick seemed to
be fascinated by his intelligent conversation.
Gavin, a mute listener, sat near by, and longed
unspeakably for a glimpse through the telescope.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and at the end of that time,
while St. Arnaud was giving his views in his clear
and musical voice on certain aspects of the planet
Saturn, Frederick’s head sunk back in his chair,
his head rested against the wall, and he slept peacefully.</p>

<p>Neither St. Arnaud nor Gavin could restrain a
feeling of pity for him then. His face, thin and
drawn, was a picture of sadness. He looked not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>only ill, but frightfully worn, and his sleep was the
sleep of exhaustion.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud raised his hand as a sign to Gavin
to keep perfectly still. He remembered the King’s
remark, that he had not slept well of late, and
thought this sudden drowsiness probably a blessed
relief. So, indeed, it was. Gradually, as he slept
more soundly, his face lost its look of pain. Soon
it was plain there was no danger of his awaking.
It grew chill in the room, and Gavin, softly taking
off his own cloak, laid it over Frederick’s knees.
The warmth appeared to soothe him still more;
he sighed profoundly, settled himself more comfortably
in his chair, and slept like a child.</p>

<p>Hours passed. No one came to disturb them,
for the light shining through the window was a
warning that no one must enter. The town grew
still as the night advanced, and in the deep silence
nothing was heard but the faint tramp of sentries
and the quiet flow of the river. But after midnight
this changed. The wind rose, clouds of inky
blackness scurried across the face of the moon,
and presently it began to rain furiously. The
heavy drops battered down like thunder upon the
roof of the observatory, but no sound awakened
Frederick, who slumbered peacefully on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>Not so Gavin and St. Arnaud, both of whom sat
up, wide-awake. There was so little chance of
awaking the King that they conversed together in
whispers.</p>

<p>“What did you see through the telescope?”
asked Gavin.</p>

<p>“That the King has no mind to help the Prince
of Bevern. I saw it as plainly as I saw the
moon.”</p>

<p>“It is strange he did not recognize us.”</p>

<p>At which St. Arnaud made a gesture which indicated
that Frederick knew them quite as well
as they knew him, but for reasons known only to
himself did not choose to admit it.</p>

<p>About two o’clock the storm increased in severity.
The sound of the rushing river was distinctly
heard over the wild swirl of wind and rain. Presently
there was a roar of waters, and looking out
of the window into the garden, forty feet below,
they saw it was flooded several feet. A culvert
had given way, and the swollen river poured
itself into the garden.</p>

<p>In the house lights were moving about. The
King’s household had determined, in spite of his
rigid prohibition, to come to the observatory after
him. But it was a question how they could get
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>there, as the water was already four feet deep and
rising rapidly.</p>

<p>Just at this moment Frederick stirred in his
sleep and waked. Like a true soldier, he had his
memory and all his wits about him the instant he
opened his eyes. He rose at once, and hearing the
noise of the storm, said:</p>

<p>“I must have slept many hours&mdash;more than I
have slept in a week. I feel much better for it.”</p>

<p>“Look, your Majesty,” said St. Arnaud, opening
the window.</p>

<p>Frederick looked out, and as he looked he
laughed. The running about in the house was
plainly visible by the moving and flashing lights.</p>

<p>“They are all in a panic over there. I suppose
they will be sending after me in a boat. It will
take time to find me.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, sire,” said Gavin. “If your Majesty
will trust yourself on my back, I can get you
over safely. The water is not yet up to my waist,
and the distance is short.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried Frederick, laughing again.
“While my staff are racing about like frightened
chickens in a barnyard I will walk in on them.”
He stooped and picked up Gavin’s cloak, which
lay on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>“I remember your laying this over my knees,
although you thought I was sleeping too soundly
to know anything; but come, the water rises every
moment.”</p>

<p>He went rapidly down the stairs, followed closely
by Gavin and St. Arnaud. Gavin stepped boldly
into the flood, which was up to his waist, and
cried to the King:</p>

<p>“Your Majesty must make yourself very small,
for my honour is engaged to get you across without
wetting you. And you must also wear my cloak
over your own.”</p>

<p>Frederick sprang up on Gavin’s back with great
agility, drawing his heels up under Gavin’s arms.
St. Arnaud covered him up well with the two
cloaks, and Gavin stepped lightly forward into
the flood. His young strength enabled him to
withstand the flow of the waters with considerable
steadiness, and it was plain he could get the King
over without difficulty. About midway, however,
he came to a dead stop.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” he asked, “do you remember
us, and that night at the country house in Silesia,
and Madame Ziska?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I do,” coolly responded Frederick,
“and had you not lost your senses, it would have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>been by no means impossible for you to have made
your escape by a rush, when I broke the door in.”</p>

<p>“So I have often thought, your Majesty, if
only I had had the wit to knock your Majesty
down. We declined to accept your parole, but
you see we got away from Glatz just the same.”</p>

<p>“I know it. That ridiculous old Kollnitz and
his ‘system.’ But I have a better man there than
Kollnitz. You could not do it so easily now.”</p>

<p>“Sire, the Empress Queen gave me a sword
for that escape, and both of us got promotion.”</p>

<p>“Very naturally. Women are always taken
with those showy things, which count, however,
for little in the long run. Your Empress Queen
is like the rest of her sex.”</p>

<p>“Sire, I do not know if you mean that disrespectfully
or not, but if you say one disparaging
word about my sovereign I will drop you into the
water if I am shot for it to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class="p2b">“Then I shall certainly speak of the Empress
Queen with the highest respect, and feel it, too,
until I am safe on dry land. Oh, the devil! Go
on!”</p>

<p class="caption">GAVIN CARRIES THE KING ACROSS THE FLOODED GARDEN</p>

<p class="p2">“With pleasure, sire, since you have so handsomely
respected my wishes,” replied Gavin, and
a few more strides brought him to the house.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
The steps were submerged, but a window on the
ground floor was yet a few inches above the water.
A general in epaulets and a cook with a paper
cap on his head heard the sound as the King
rapped loudly on the panes. The window was
raised by them, and with their help Frederick
stepped inside. When he threw off his outer cloak
he was as dry as a bone. Gavin, who had climbed
in after him, was like a river god, water streaming
from every part of him. Frederick, who disliked
to be questioned, said to the officer:</p>

<p>“Take this gentleman and provide him with
dry clothes. He is Lieutenant Gavin Hamilton
of the Imperialist army, as you know. His companion,
Captain St. Arnaud, is still at the observatory.
Let a boat be sent for Captain St. Arnaud
as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>While Frederick was speaking, he had turned
to a table near by, and was writing a few words
rapidly. He handed the sheet of paper to Gavin.
On it was scrawled in the King’s peculiar handwriting:
“On the night of the first of March,
1758, Lieutenant Gavin Hamilton brought me on
his back through my flooded garden at Breslau,
with the water four feet deep. Midway he
stopped and we conversed. The name of the Empress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
Queen being mentioned, Lieutenant Hamilton
told me if I should speak disrespectfully of her
Majesty he would drop me in the water if he were
shot next morning for it. I had no thought
of speaking disrespectfully of her Majesty, but if
I had done so, I have no doubt Lieutenant Hamilton
would have instantly carried out his threat.
Frédéric.”</p>

<p>Gavin’s mouth came open in a tremendous grin
as he read this, the more so when Frederick good-humouredly
added:</p>

<p>“That ought to be good for one step in promotion
at least.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> through the night the storm raged. The
air grew warm and murky, and thunder and lightning
roared and flashed. The river, swollen by
other streams, overflowed its banks, and flooded
all of the old part of the town where the King’s
headquarters were. St. Arnaud had been brought
from the observatory in a boat, and had got
drenched to the bone in the process. There was no
possibility at that hour, between two and three
in the morning, of St. Arnaud and Gavin getting
back to their own quarters. Supplied with dry
clothes by the officers of the King’s military family,
and given a room with a bed and a sofa in it,
they threw themselves down, still dressed, to sleep.
Gavin, with the readiness of a child to go to sleep,
dropped into a deep slumber within two minutes.
St. Arnaud, much fatigued, yet found himself
kept awake by the commotion of the storm. Great
peals of deafening thunder shook the house; the
wind, blowing frightfully hard, rattled the windows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
until it sounded like a continuous discharge
of musketry. The surging of the waters could
be heard only at intervals, while torrents of rain
descended. St. Arnaud, weary, but quite unable
to sleep, rose, and went to the window. The blackness
of darkness encompassed everything except
for the lightning flashes, which zigzagged across the
inky sky, showing the whole dreadful scene. The
streets were altogether submerged, and both sentry
boxes had floated away. Trees were twisted off
and sent scurrying along the raging waters; some
bodies of drowned animals floated by.</p>

<p>In the gleam of the lightning St. Arnaud saw
that all the houses in the neighbourhood were
lighted up and the people astir. In the house in
which he was no one slept except Gavin. St. Arnaud
heard officers moving about, prepared, in
case of a catastrophe, which was far from improbable.</p>

<p>As the wild sky turned from black to a pallid
gray, without any abatement of the storm, St.
Arnaud saw all the destruction it had wrought.
Opposite him was a house with far-projecting
eaves. The wind, which had lulled somewhat, suddenly
rose to a gust, and the roof went skyward
with a crash of breaking timbers. A cry from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>invisible sources rent the air, as, at a window, in
the roofless house, appeared a man, half dressed.
The house shook and tottered, the walls seeming
about to fall in. The man, a young fellow, evidently
a workman, coolly prepared to spring into
the water. He leaped none too soon. The walls,
weakened by the floods and the tearing away of the
roof, cracked inward as he struck the water. He
was evidently no swimmer, but with great self-possession
floated flat on his back. A dozen persons
appeared at the neighbouring windows, ready
to assist him; but, carried by the flood, he was
floating straight for a little balcony on which the
window of St. Arnaud’s room opened. St. Arnaud
stepped out promptly, to catch him as he passed;
but to his surprise looked up, and Gavin was beside
him.</p>

<p>“That infernal racket waked me at last,” he
said.</p>

<p>Both of them sat astride the balustrade in order
to catch the man still floating straight toward
them. He reached Gavin first, who, leaning forward,
with his long, muscular arms outstretched,
caught him firmly, and proceeded to drag him on to
the balcony by main force. In some way, however,
Gavin lost his balance, and if St. Arnaud had not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>come to the rescue would have gone over himself.
As it was, he could do little toward helping St.
Arnaud to drag the workman on to the balcony;
and as soon as it was accomplished he limped inside
the open window. Half a dozen officers,
among them the King’s surgeon, were then in the
room to assist the workman, who had suffered nothing
worse than a wetting, and to ask if there were
any persons in the house when it collapsed. There
were none, and a servant was directed to take the
man below and give him some dry clothes. While
this was going on no one noticed Gavin, who sat on
a chair, nursing his leg. When they turned to
him, however, he was slipping off his chair, and the
next instant he lay in a heap on the floor, in a dead
faint.</p>

<p>The King’s surgeon was down on his knees in
a moment, trying to bring Gavin to, while his
clothes were unloosed by St. Arnaud. In a few
minutes he recovered, only to groan with pain.
His leg was badly wrenched, and when the surgeon
examined it, he horrified both Gavin and St.
Arnaud by saying:</p>

<p>“You have a bad sprain, and you will not be
able to move to-day or to-morrow, or for a good
many days to come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>And too true it proved.</p>

<p>With daylight came an abatement of the storm,
but an increase of the flood. There had been many
casualties, and as long as the flood lasted there
was great danger. The King, who had not slept
since he left the observatory, was active in taking
measures of safety for the soldiers and citizens;
but he did not forget to have Gavin and St. Arnaud
made comfortable. He expressed much sympathy
for Gavin’s misfortune, inquired how they were
lodged, ordered two communicating rooms to be
given to them, and desired them to ask for anything
they wished.</p>

<p>Their position, however, was highly uncomfortable.
Gavin proved the worst of patients
from the beginning. He was fretful and irritable,
impatient of pain, and made himself much worse
by his wilfulness and childishness. St. Arnaud,
whom he adored, was the chief victim of his wrath.
Nothing could exceed St. Arnaud’s kindness and
unflagging attention, but it was helpless to soothe
Gavin. When St. Arnaud was present, everything
he said and did was wrong. When he was absent
for a few moments, he was met with a storm of
reproaches on his return. He bore it all with smiling
patience; but when once he could not refrain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>from laughing, Gavin threw himself about so, in
his agony of impatience, that even St. Arnaud was
a little frightened.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day of the accident, the
King sent word that he would come, after he had
supped, and see Lieutenant Hamilton. St. Arnaud
proceeded to make him ready. He lay on
a sofa, his unlucky leg on a chair. He growled
and grumbled when St. Arnaud, with the tenderness
and dexterity of a woman, made him presentable
for the King. As St. Arnaud brushed
Gavin’s dark hair, which he had let grow in ringlets
since he had become an officer, Gavin snapped
out:</p>

<p>“I did not curry my horse so hard when I was
a private soldier.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” replied St. Arnaud coolly;
“but you must remember I am not used to currying
horses&mdash;I have had no instruction in that line.”</p>

<p>Gavin remained silent, but only slightly
ashamed.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud had a real fear that Gavin would
not behave himself properly on the occasion of
the King’s visit; but he had not altogether given
the complete rein to folly.</p>

<p>About eight o’clock, the King, entirely unattended,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
entered. Frederick of Prussia had a passion
for men of <i>esprit</i>, and at this period of his
career, having lost much of his taste for the other
amusements of life, he grew more fond of the
society of brilliant and polished men than ever before.
Especially was this true concerning Frenchmen,
who had for him a peculiar charm; and St.
Arnaud, on the two occasions they had met, had
afforded him extreme entertainment. On St. Arnaud’s
part, he perfectly understood how far he
stood in the King’s good graces. A knowledge of
courts had given him a just appreciation of this
sort of favour from princes; he did not delude himself
with the idea that it meant a solid regard, and
he despised the understandings of those who take
the chance liking of monarchs for more than what
it is. He maintained, therefore, with Frederick
an attitude of easy, but respectful independence,
which gave their intercourse enough of equality
to be agreeable. As for Gavin, Frederick only remembered
him as a spirited but rather awkward
boy; however, Gavin’s threat to throw him into
the water if he spoke disrespectfully of the Empress
Queen had diverted him extremely, and to
divert the King of Prussia once was a guarantee of
being expected to do it again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>Gavin, who was lying on the sofa with his leg on
a chair, endeavoured to rise, as St. Arnaud did,
when the King entered; but Frederick good-naturedly
ordered him to keep still.</p>

<p>“I shall not take advantage of your helplessness
to speak disrespectfully of the Empress
Queen,” he said, laughing; and motioning St.
Arnaud to be seated, drew a chair up to the fire.</p>

<p>“The fact is,” he continued, with a slight laugh,
as musical as his delightful voice, “I never speak
disrespectfully of her Majesty. It has been my
misfortune to be much disliked by two ladies&mdash;the
Czarina of Russia and the Empress Queen&mdash;and,
consequently, I have led a bad life of it for several
years. These two ladies, between them, and
with the assistance of the Dauphiness of France,
have leagued against me populations amounting to
a hundred millions of souls. There are not five
millions of Prussians; but we have tried to give
a good account of ourselves.”</p>

<p>“And your Majesty has certainly done so,” replied
St. Arnaud. “Luckily for us, your Majesty
does not command everywhere.”</p>

<p>“No; and I have Winterfeld no longer.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud had perfect control of his countenance,
and it was design, and not inadvertence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>which made him, at the mention of Winterfeld, fix
his clear eyes upon Frederick’s, equally clear, and
piercing in their power of expression. He remembered
that General Winterfeld, who had been
called the King’s only friend, had lost his life at
the beginning of the Prince of Bevern’s unfortunate
campaign, and it had been said that Frederick
held Bevern’s faulty arrangements partly accountable
for Winterfeld’s death.</p>

<p>After a pause, St. Arnaud spoke:</p>

<p>“General Winterfeld was under the command
of the Prince of Bevern, to whom I am indebted
for the opportunity of seeing your Majesty at this
time.”</p>

<p>A smile, faint but full of meaning and not altogether
pleasant, appeared in the comers of Frederick’s
mouth and shone in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, tapping his breast. “I have
Bevern’s letter here. I have read it attentively.
Be sure you tell him that.”</p>

<p>“And permit me, sire, to say, that I apprehend
I shall have no other reply to take the Prince
of Bevern when I return.”</p>

<p>“You are a good diplomatist, Captain St. Arnaud.
You know my meaning, without plaguing
me with questions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>“Thanks, sire; and as far as my errand goes
I might leave to-morrow morning. But this young
gentleman will not be able to move for a week at
least, so the surgeon says.”</p>

<p>“And there is not a bridge standing within
fifty miles, I hear. So make yourself satisfied,
and exchange winter quarters at Breslau for winter
quarters at Vienna for a little while. You will
not find it gay. Last month, my sister, the Princess
Amelia, was here, and there were some balls
and concerts; but as the time for taking the field
approaches there is work to be done. I have been
wretchedly ill, and do not think I shall be well
until spring opens, and I again sleep in a tent with
the flap open.”</p>

<p>“Beating us evidently does not agree with your
Majesty’s health.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well! This year&mdash;who knows? But, as
you are a well-informed man, can you tell me of
any campaign of ancient or modern times in which
there have been such vast vicissitudes as in the last
eight months?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I cannot, your Majesty. The French
and Austrians have alternated a <i>Te Deum</i> with a
<i>De profundis</i> ever since this year’s leaves appeared
on the trees.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>“So have I. Those two ladies I spoke of in
Austria and Russia have given me no peace at all,
nor do they seem likely to. I hear the Empress
Queen has horsed her artillery from the imperial
stables. We are quits, for I have melted up mountains
of useless silver knick-knacks at my unused
palaces for money for my pay chest. You see, I
am frank&mdash;the wiseacres say I am too free in my
talk&mdash;but I take it, that the world notes my determination
to maintain my kingdom the better
only for seeing how ready I am to sacrifice for
my army the baubles which most kings cherish far
beyond their value.”</p>

<p>“True, sire, her Majesty made no secret of it
when she ordered the doors of the imperial stables
to be thrown wide, and Field-Marshal Daun to
take the best of all he saw.”</p>

<p>During this talk Gavin had listened with all
his ears. The reflection came to him with great
force, “How much more is there in personality than
in words! Everything said by this great man,
no matter how much it resembles the language of
other men, has a deeper significance. His beautiful
and eloquent eyes and his strangely musical
voice make even his most ordinary conversation
memorable.” And for once Gavin was willing to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>remain silent and a listener; so, too, was St. Arnaud;
but Frederick was an admirable talker in
two senses&mdash;he listened as gracefully as he talked,
and his pleasure in being entertained was as strong
as his pleasure in entertaining. He led St. Arnaud
to speak of the French court. St. Arnaud,
who had infinite tact, managed to describe it without
touching on the ugly side of it&mdash;the scandals,
the corruption, the weakness of the King, and the
ascendancy of Madame de Pompadour. He did
not once mention the favourite’s name; but when a
pause in the conversation came, Frederick said
suddenly:</p>

<p>“And how about Madame de Pompadour?”</p>

<p>“I thought, sire,” responded St. Arnaud, “that
you did not know of her existence. At least, M.
Voltaire says when he gave you Madame de Pompadour’s
regards, you said, ‘I don’t know her.’”</p>

<p>Frederick looked gravely into St. Arnaud’s
eyes, and then they both burst out laughing, and
Frederick said:</p>

<p>“You should have seen M. Voltaire’s face before
and after I made my remark. Harlequin in
the show did not change so rapidly. I think that
lady does not like me, either; and as for your
Dauphiness&mdash;well, I am truly unfortunate in being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
so unpopular with the fair sex. I have done
nothing to deserve it. Had they but allowed me
to remain in peace! For peace is my dream, let
me tell you. A man must have his dreams; who
should know that better than I, whose early life
was all spent in dreams? Even now I am fighting
to conquer a peace.”</p>

<p>“So say all great captains, sire.”</p>

<p>“True; but most great captains have ulterior
views. I have already all I want in this life&mdash;the
throne of Prussia&mdash;if only those ladies I spoke of
would let me enjoy it in quietness.”</p>

<p>“And the Empress Queen bewails daily that
she, too, must ever be at war. If only she and the
Emperor could have a little time to enjoy their
heritage! The Empress Queen takes great interest
in guns both great and small. Prince Leuchtenberg,
who is the head of our artillery, often
comes to the palace with his books and portfolios
of drawings, and her Majesty says, ‘Such beautiful
guns are too good to be used in killing the
poor soldiers of the King of Prussia.’”</p>

<p>“But they are probably not too good to be used
in killing the King of Prussia. Eh?”</p>

<p>“I do not think, sire, that her Majesty counts
you among her favourites, or contemplates leaving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>you any part of her private fortune, or even money
to buy a mourning ring.”</p>

<p>“She hates me like the devil. However, speaking
of those guns, the Austrian artillery is as good
as any in the world, my own not excepted. You
did not invent the iron rammers and ramrods, but
as soon as the Prince of Dessau contrived them
you adopted them. Men have never ceased to labour
diligently at the task of inventing implements
with which to destroy men.”</p>

<p>“And never will, sire.”</p>

<p>“Let us be thankful that a part of their energy
is put into efforts to save life. I have cause to be
grateful for that, because but for the new discovery
of the Jesuits’ bark, I would have died of
fever this winter. Even the Empress Queen would
have pitied me if she had seen me in my paroxysms
of burning fever and shivering cold. The Jesuits’
bark, though, has helped me.”</p>

<p>The conversation continued for hours. St.
Arnaud seemed to exercise a charmed spell over
Frederick, and when he laughingly owned up to a
weakness for making verses, Frederick cried out
with delight:</p>

<p>“Now have I found a man who can both fight
and write. Nature had not made up her mind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>whether I should be a soldier or a poet or a musician
when she thrust me into this world. Fate
decided the question for her, but Nature will still
be heard. I have made bushels of verses this last
autumn, in spite of Rosbach and Leuthen. And
my flute is always in my pocket, though not often
at my mouth.”</p>

<p>Gavin could remain silent no longer. He cried
out:</p>

<p>“And, your Majesty, St. Arnaud still plays the
harpsichord. Don’t you remember the night you
took us prisoners how beautifully he played and
sang too?”</p>

<p>Frederick, who was in high good humour,
laughed extremely at this, exchanging significant
glances with St. Arnaud, who said:</p>

<p>“Pray, pardon him, sire. He has not much experience
with sovereigns.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” responded Gavin; “but then,
your Majesty, when one has had a man’s hand on
his coat collar, and has been dragged through
broken glass, as I was by you, it makes one feel
well acquainted with that man, even if he be a
king.”</p>

<p>An aide-de-camp, walking up and down the corridor
outside the door, stopped another young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>officer, going in an opposite direction, whispering:</p>

<p>“Do you hear the King laughing in there with
those two French officers? Did ever you hear him
so free and merry with <i>us</i>?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“And did ever you hear him praise any of his
own generals as he is always praising the French
and Austrian generals?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he praised Winterfeld after he was
dead.”</p>

<p>“They have brought a letter from the Prince of
Bevern, about his exchange. Do you think the
King will lift his finger for Bevern?”</p>

<p>“As well expect water to run up hill. This
King of ours is rightly called Great, but he has
ever regarded misfortune as a crime. So, therefore,
let us always be lucky, and we shall be rewarded.”</p>

<p>The officer passed on, laughing. Just then St.
Arnaud, opening the door of their room, respectfully
ushered the King out, who was saying:</p>

<p>“Remember, the first clear night we go to the
observatory together.” The young aide, standing
rigidly at attention, saluted the King, who passed
on without seeing him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>Several days went by, that seemed a nightmare
for Gavin, and a strange but not unpleasant dream
to St. Arnaud. Gavin’s injury, which was really
trifling, was aggravated by his impatience. He
persisted in trying to walk about his room, in
spite of the surgeon’s prohibition, and at the end
of the week was but little better off than he had
been at the beginning. St. Arnaud had his hands
full in trying to take care of him, and every evening
he spent with the King. Frederick, to ensure
freedom from disturbance, would go to St. Arnaud’s
room. A harpsichord had been placed
there, and often the sound of the harpsichord and
flute would float out. There had been no visits
for several nights to the observatory, as the wind
and rain storms had been succeeded by heavy
snows. St. Arnaud had completely fascinated
Frederick, who was always singularly susceptible
to the charm of conversation. It was impossible
for any one to resist Frederick’s own powers to
please when he exerted himself, and St. Arnaud
found himself falling more and more under the
spell of a great and comprehensive mind, like that
of the King of Prussia.</p>

<p>Within ten days, though, in spite of doing
many things to retard his recovery, Gavin’s leg
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>grew so much better that St. Arnaud said to the
King:</p>

<p>“Sire, Lieutenant Hamilton is now in condition
to travel, and it is our duty to return, especially
out of consideration to the Prince of Bevern.”</p>

<p>“Do not trouble yourself about Bevern. The
roads are not yet in condition to travel. You will
be delayed on the way. Why not remain here?
Besides, to-night will be clear, and we must have
another night at the telescope.”</p>

<p>Two days passed before St. Arnaud again mentioned
it to the King. Both nights had been spent
in the observatory.</p>

<p>“Sire,” he said, “I cannot any longer restrain
the impatience of Lieutenant Hamilton. He is
anxious to return to Vienna, and, as you know, he
is very rash and inexperienced; I cannot answer
for what he may say or do if he does not return
at once.”</p>

<p>“Send him to me.”</p>

<p>Gavin, for the first time walking without a stick,
went into the King’s room. It was evening, and
the King stood before a large fire.</p>

<p>“So you will not wait until the surgeons say
your leg is well enough for you to travel?”</p>

<p>“Sire, my leg is quite well enough to travel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>“A few days more of rest would be better for
it. Your friend, Captain St. Arnaud, is not so
eager to leave you as you are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, your Majesty, if you talked to me as you
do to St. Arnaud, I would be willing to stay, too.
But I know that I am not so well worth talking
to&mdash;I am not accomplished, and do not know the
world and the people in it as St. Arnaud does&mdash;and,
besides, I have a mother at Vienna that I
had not seen for a long time until a few weeks
ago.”</p>

<p>Frederick could not forbear smiling at Gavin’s
<i>naïveté</i>.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said; “wait but two days more
in patience; the moon is at the full, and I desire
to study it with St. Arnaud, and by that time it
will be possible for you to start.”</p>

<p>The two days brought very great improvement
to Gavin’s leg. He walked about the streets,
threw away his stick, packed up such belongings
as he had brought with him, and announced his
readiness to start at any moment. All of the second
day they had expected a message from the
King saying horses were at their disposal for their
travelling chaise; but the only message they got
from him was, that, when supper was over, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>would have a little concert in his own apartments,
to which St. Arnaud and Gavin were asked.</p>

<p>“We must go. It is now too late in the day
to take the road,” said St. Arnaud.</p>

<p>Gavin, choking with rage and disappointment,
said no word. St. Arnaud began to make a careful
toilet, while Gavin sullenly watched him. To
St. Arnaud’s laughing remark, that royal invitations
must always be accepted, Gavin only replied:</p>

<p>“The King will not know whether I am there
or not.”</p>

<p>Seeing he was in a dangerously bad humour, St.
Arnaud said nothing more and left the room. As
soon as he was gone Gavin sat down to the writing-table
and dashed off a letter to him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“You have just left the room for the King’s
apartment as I write this. That man has bewitched
you. You will not leave this place for a
week yet. I cannot stand it another day. I am
gone. You will find me at Vienna when you arrive,
which I believe will not be until the campaign
actually opens, and the King is obliged to
send you away. G. H.”</p></div>

<p>Having written this in much haste and fury,
Gavin put together his money and papers, including<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
Frederick’s memorandum concerning their
conversation in the flooded garden, stowing them
in his breast pocket, and, wrapping his cloak
around him, walked downstairs; and watching the
moment when the sentry’s back was turned,
slipped out of the door and into a side street.</p>

<p>It was already late in the evening, and the city
was poorly lighted, which was favourable to his
designs. He walked toward the more thinly settled
quarters of the town, following the course of
the river. He had no plan in his mind, and was
simply yielding to a wild impulse. Not until his
eye fell upon a number of boats moored near a
boat-house under a bridge did a connected idea of
the best mode of getting out of Breslau present
itself to him. He stepped into a boat, picked up
the oars, and pulled rapidly with the stream. It
was quite dark, and he could only faintly discern
the straggling buildings on the shore and an occasional
figure flitting past in the gloom of evening.
He knew nothing of the town, but felt sure
that at some point the river was watched and
defended. In a little while he came to that point&mdash;a
bridge, near which fortifications loomed, and
on which the steady tramp of a sentry’s feet could
be heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>Watching until the sentry was near the end of
the bridge, Gavin, with a few swift strokes, found
himself in darkness under the arches. There he
waited until the sentry again left the middle of
the bridge, and some minutes more of hard pulling
carried the boat a considerable distance down the
stream. Gavin, pulling away with the greatest
energy, congratulated himself on the ease with
which he had got out of Breslau.</p>

<p>“As soon as I am quite clear of the outposts,”
he thought, “I will go ashore, and make straight
for the nearest military post where they do not
have to report at Vienna, and with my papers
and my uniform I can easily get a safe-conduct
through the Prussian lines. And how cheap will
St. Arnaud feel when I arrive at Vienna a week
ahead of him!”</p>

<p>Inspired with these agreeable ideas, Gavin
tugged valiantly at his oars, and being heated with
the exercise, took off his coat; his cloak already
lay in the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>Having pulled for nearly two hours, he found
himself far in the open country. The moon was
then rising, and by its light he saw a smooth, wide
road, leading down to a landing-place. Concluding
this to be a good place to disembark, he rowed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>ashore, put on his coat and cloak, and took the
road.</p>

<p>He had not travelled more than two miles when
he struck the highway to Breslau. He remembered
various landmarks at that point, and discovered
to his joy that he was quite eight miles
from the city gates.</p>

<p>Trudging along cheerfully in the moonlight,
away from Breslau, he heard behind him a clatter
of hoofs. Ten or twelve troopers, with a non-commissioned
officer riding at their head, were coming
rapidly down the road. Involuntarily, Gavin
started to conceal himself in the hedge by the roadside;
but the troopers were too quick for him.
One of them saw him, galloped toward him, and,
seizing him by the collar, held him until the sergeant
rode up.</p>

<p>Gavin made no effort to escape, and, in truth,
was rather glad to be caught, and said promptly to
the sergeant, a coarse, brutal-looking fellow:</p>

<p>“I am Lieutenant Hamilton, of the First Austrian
Hussar Regiment. I have been to Breslau
with a flag of truce with a companion, Captain
St. Arnaud, of General Loudon’s corps;
but being impatient to return to Vienna, I
quietly walked away this evening, and if you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>can help me on my way, I shall be infinitely
obliged.”</p>

<p>“I see you wear the uniform of an Austrian
officer, but what have you got to prove the remarkable
tale you are telling us?” replied the sergeant
gruffly.</p>

<p>Gavin put his hand in his breast pocket. It
was quite empty.</p>

<p>“My papers!” he cried. “My papers and
money&mdash;they are all lost! I must have left them
in the boat.”</p>

<p>“Come along with us,” said the sergeant. “I
have to report to my captain, who is ten miles off.
I believe you are a spy, and woe befall you if my
captain thinks so, too; for he had a brother strung
up as a spy by you Austrians last year, and he has
sworn that an Austrian officer shall swing for
it.” Then, to a trooper:</p>

<p>“Dismount, and get a horse from the farmhouse
over there and follow us.”</p>

<p>The trooper dismounted, and Gavin, obeying a
signal, got into the saddle, and in another minute
he was trotting briskly down the road with the
party.</p>

<p>Gavin had scarcely heard the word spy, he was
so distressed and disheartened by the loss of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>money and papers. The sergeant, who rode by
his side, asked him no questions, and in perfect
silence they traversed the road rapidly by
the light of a brilliant moon.</p>

<p>It was quite midnight before they halted at a
little village, and, riding up to one of the chief
houses, dismounted. Gavin was at once ushered
into the presence of the commanding officer, Captain
Dreisel, an ill-looking man, whose appearance
was not improved by a dirty nightcap over a
frowzy wig.</p>

<p>The sergeant, who was by nature a lover of sensations,
coolly announced that he had captured
a spy. Gavin, who had paid no attention to the
man, received a sudden and terrible shock when
Dreisel said, in the coolest manner in the world:</p>

<p>“You must disprove what this man says, or you
will be hanged as a spy in twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>“But I am in my uniform as sublieutenant of
General Loudon’s hussars! I am a prisoner of
war.”</p>

<p>“So was my brother,” replied Dreisel, coolly
lighting a huge pipe. “Nevertheless, the Austrians
hanged him. They made a thousand explanations
afterward, alleged that it was an infernal
mistake, and all that, and punished everybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
connected with the affair; but it could not
bring my brother back. And, besides, you may
have stolen that uniform. At all events, I have
three sublieutenants here, and we will settle the
matter for you after breakfast to-morrow morning,
without troubling headquarters with it.
Meanwhile, I am going to bed. Sergeant, watch
this man;” and Dreisel sauntered into the next
room.</p>

<p>The sergeant, leaving a couple of soldiers on
guard, went out, and Gavin sat down on a bench
before the stove to rest, for he did not think he
could sleep. He was very hungry, and asking the
soldier who walked up and down outside the room
door if anything to eat was to be had, the man
pointed to a cupboard. Out of it Gavin got some
bread and cheese, and then, lying down on the
bench, proceeded to sum up the situation, with the
result that he considered his chances for being
hanged within the next twenty-four hours about
as certain as they well could be. But although this
was his deliberate and reasonable conclusion, it
by no means followed that he actually believed he
was going to be hanged. On the contrary, it
seemed altogether an impossibility, and the conditions
surrounding him appeared to him more unreal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
than the wildest dream he ever had in his
life. He pinched himself to find whether he was
awake. The last time he had eaten, before getting
the bread and cheese out of the cupboard,
had been at the King’s headquarters in Breslau.
He noted that the bread and cheese had no flavour
to it; he only knew that he was eating by the
looks, not the taste. Yet, it must be something
portentous that could make him feel so strangely,
and then he recalled all the circumstances, which
led him to believe that he had fallen into the hands
of a vengeful and desperate man, and something
very like a promise had been made him that he
would be hanged within twenty-four hours; and
going over and over the whole puzzling business,
he suddenly fell asleep, his dark, boyish head resting
on his arm against the wall.</p>

<p>At daylight he was awake in the same strange
mental state. The soldiers who guarded him were
amazed at his coolness, but it was really the insensibility
of a person too dazed and astounded
to think or even feel, to a great degree. He was
given a good breakfast, which he ate with appetite;
but he might have been eating shavings, as
far as his palate went. It annoyed him the way
the soldiers and the guard looked at him. There
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>was something pitying in their glance, as if they
expected him to be hanged&mdash;an idea so ridiculous
to Gavin that he could have laughed aloud at it.
Yet it did not seem ridiculous to them, and that
was both strange and disagreeable. Altogether, it
was the most unpleasant morning of his life. He
was left to himself all the forenoon, but soon after
the captain’s midday dinner he was summoned
to appear in another room. Seated at the head of
the table was Captain Dreisel. One look at his
determined and savage countenance showed Gavin
that he could not appear before a worse judge.
Chance had thrown a victim in this man’s way&mdash;a
man looking for a victim. It was enough.</p>

<p>Three sublieutenants were seated also at the
table, to give it something the appearance of a
court martial. They were all young and beardless
fellows, and what impressed Gavin as much as
anything else was the distress and agitation visible
upon the countenances of these young subalterns.
They looked anxiously at one another, and it was
plain that the work before them was not to their
liking.</p>

<p>Gavin, after saluting, was given a chair and
seated himself. Never in his life had his soul been
in such a tumult as at that moment; yet never had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>he been outwardly more calm or more entirely in
possession of his senses, which presently returned
to him.</p>

<p>Dreisel began the examination, and Gavin told
clearly and frankly all that had befallen him.
But, to his consternation, he saw at every word
that the three younger officers were losing confidence
in him. Great as was their sympathy for
him, his adventures, especially his claim of having
lived at the King’s headquarters for three weeks,
were too unusual to be accepted without proof.
And of proof he had not a scintilla.</p>

<p>The examination was done almost entirely by
Dreisel, whose artfully contrived questions were
admirably adapted to put Gavin in the worst
possible light. He felt, himself, the improbable
nature of some of his replies, which, though
strictly truthful, yet had an appearance of extravagance.
As he was plied thick and fast, answering
each question eagerly, it was plain that
he was not making a good impression upon the
three young officers, who, he saw, hated and dreaded
the outcome. He saw glances of dismay exchanged
among them at some of his answers, and
one of these young officers, whose countenance
was particularly mild, grew paler and paler,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>while great drops stood out on his forehead. At
last, after an hour of torture, Dreisel said to
him:</p>

<p>“And you expect us to believe that you are
not a spy?”</p>

<p>At the word spy Gavin involuntarily started.
It was the first time the word had been uttered
in the presence of the other officers. Nevertheless,
he responded promptly:</p>

<p>“I cannot be held as a spy wearing this uniform.”</p>

<p>“True, according to the rules of war among
civilized nations. But my brother was hanged
as a spy wearing the Prussian uniform.”</p>

<p>The young officer, who had shown such unmistakable
marks of distress, interposed at this:</p>

<p>“But the whole affair was disclaimed, sir, by
the Austrian military authorities.”</p>

<p>“Well, so may all our proceedings to-day be
disclaimed by the Prussian military authorities.”</p>

<p class="p2b">Dreisel said this with a diabolical grin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="illo6"><img src="images/i_216.jpg" width="500" alt="“TAKE CHARGE OF THE PRISONER UNTIL I SEND FOR HIM”"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">“TAKE CHARGE OF THE PRISONER UNTIL I SEND FOR HIM”</p>

<p class="p2">“But I am zealous in the King’s cause; and
if I hang a man because I think him a spy, and,
moreover, has designs upon the King’s life&mdash;for
that is the meaning of his skulking about the
King’s headquarters for three weeks&mdash;<i>if</i> he ever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>was there&mdash;it ought not to go very hard with me.
Let me ask each and all of you this, Do you believe
all the prisoner has told us?”</p>

<p>A dead silence greeted this. Dreisel called to
the sergeant outside the door, and said to him
when he came in:</p>

<p>“Take charge of the prisoner until I send for
him.”</p>

<p>Gavin rose without a word. Had words availed
him, he would have poured them forth; but he
saw that they were worse than useless. As he
passed out, the young officer who had shown such
sympathy for him half rose from his chair, and
looking at Gavin with eyes of misery, seemed
about to hold out his hand.</p>

<p>“You had better not, my friend,” said Gavin,
unable to keep silence any longer. “Perhaps you
may be shot for shaking hands with a prisoner
of war about to be hanged.”</p>

<p>In the corridor leading to the room to which
he was conveyed there was a window looking
straight into the window of the court-martial
room. The sentry who passed the door near
which Gavin sat also passed this window in his
walk up and down the corridor. Something of
sympathy in the man’s eye as he glanced in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>room where Gavin sat, with the sergeant at his
side, caused Gavin to say:</p>

<p>“My friend, I, too, once carried a musket before
I wore a sword; therefore, I beg of you, as a
comrade, to tell me what Captain Dreisel and his
unhappy young officers are doing in that room.”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant von Bulow, the soft-hearted one,
is standing up speaking to Captain Dreisel,” he
said in a low voice.</p>

<p>The man walked away, and, passing the window,
returned in five minutes to the open door. He
again whispered:</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Reber is now talking very earnestly,
and seems not afraid of the captain.”</p>

<p>The third time he passed the door the sentry’s
face was ashy pale.</p>

<p>“Captain Dreisel is speaking now, and Lieutenant
von Bulow has covered his face and is crying.”</p>

<p>“Is he?” was Gavin’s only remark. “Good
Von Bulow. I suppose I am to be hanged. Well,
I will lie down on this bench and think over
things a little.”</p>

<p>He lay out at full length on the bench, and
thoughts of all sorts chased one another through his
mind. He had the tenderest thoughts of his
mother and of St. Arnaud and Madame Ziska
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>and her family, and the most acute pity for himself.
“No wonder Von Bulow weeps at the
thought of an innocent young man being hanged.
I would weep for Von Bulow under the same circumstances.”
But he could not perceive, much to
his surprise, any sensation of fear or weakness.
He felt his pulse&mdash;it was beating with perfect
steadiness&mdash;he took up a glass of water and drank
it without the tremor of a finger, and lying calmly
down again, closed his eyes. And the soldiers
watching him saw a strange thing&mdash;his breathing
grew slower, his limbs relaxed, and he was sleeping
as peacefully as an infant. Gavin himself fell
into the most delicious dream&mdash;he was walking
with his mother in the gardens at Schoenbrunn;
it was a lovely spring morning, and he carried his
hat in his hand to feel the soft, sweet breeze, and
his mother was saying to him:</p>

<p>“Now, dear Gavin, we shall be so happy together;
there will be no more separations for us.”</p>

<p>He was roused from this by a vigorous shaking,
and St. Arnaud’s voice saying:</p>

<p>“Wake up! You don’t seem to mind the notion
of being hanged; but for my part, I could
give you ten good beatings for the misery and anxiety
your folly has cost me.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gavin</span> sat up, rubbed his eyes, remained silent
for some minutes, while St. Arnaud berated him,
winding up with:</p>

<p>“Two hours later, and you would have been
hanged.”</p>

<p>“I thought so, too,” replied Gavin. “Dreisel,
the captain, was bent on it. But how came you
here?”</p>

<p>“By following you, of course. I left the concert
early, and went to our quarters, to find you
gone and your letter on the table. I gave the
alarm immediately, not knowing what trouble you
might get into. I suspected at once that you would
try the river, as there was less chance of your
being stopped, and we&mdash;Captain Bohlen and I&mdash;were
after you in a boat within an hour after you
took to the water. We found the boat and your
papers in it&mdash;I have the papers with me&mdash;and had
no difficulty in tracking you to the place where you
were captured. There we had some delay. Several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
small bodies of men were moving about that
night, and we lost some hours in finding which
one had bagged you. As soon as we discovered
that your friend, Captain Dreisel, was the man,
we lost not a moment, for he has openly said he
means to hang an Austrian officer. They were still
debating when we arrived; the young sublieutenants
showed more courage than Dreisel counted on,
and threatened to refuse to obey orders if you were
sentenced to be hanged. You should have seen
them when Bohlen and I walked in on them.
Dreisel was perfectly cool and collected; he saw
that he was balked, and probably ruined for life,
as Bohlen will lay the whole matter before the
King. The three lieutenants nearly had hysterics
from joy. Bohlen means to ask promotion for
them, since they saved the Prussian army the
disgrace of hanging an Austrian officer. When
we asked for you, behold, you were asleep! What
a fellow you are!”</p>

<p>Gavin sprang up, and seizing St. Arnaud
around the neck, they kissed and embraced.</p>

<p>At that moment Gavin glanced up. Bohlen,
Von Bulow, and the other two lieutenants were
entering the room. They crowded around him
and wrung his hand, and Von Bulow, fairly bursting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
into tears, embraced him. They all laughed
at Von Bulow; but every man of them felt shaken
by the crisis each had passed through. Turning
to the soldiers, especially the sentry and the sergeant,
Gavin emptied his pockets, and then with
one accord all the officers went out of the house
that still sheltered Dreisel.</p>

<p>“I breathe better,” cried Von Bulow, snuffing
the chill, clear air, “out of the quarters of that
wretch.”</p>

<p>“Think what we have endured since this morning,”
added his brother lieutenant. “We would
have died where we sat rather than have acquiesced
in murder; but we did not know whether
our men would obey us or Dreisel.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, gentlemen,” quietly remarked
Bohlen, “wait until I make my report to his
Majesty. Dreisel then will rue the day he was
born.”</p>

<p>It was late in the cold March afternoon, and
the village inn looked very inviting. In it they
went, and spent a long evening together. Great
was the jollity of all of them, except Gavin, in
whom all saw the signs of a reaction. He sat silent
for the most part, and his eyes, when they met
those of the others, were filled with tears of gratitude.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
When they separated for the night, St.
Arnaud demanded but one room for himself and
Gavin. Alone together, Gavin broke down utterly.
St. Arnaud spent the night soothing and
cheering him. And this was the man who had
gone calmly to sleep while the question of hanging
him was being debated!</p>

<p>Next morning, St. Arnaud announced that they
would return to Breslau, for the purpose of expressing
their thanks to the King and saying farewell.
As for the report of the affair, Bohlen might
be trusted to attend faithfully to that. Gavin
submitted to the delay without a word. They
reached Breslau in the afternoon, went straight
to their old quarters, and at eight o’clock&mdash;the
King’s usual hour for seeing them&mdash;they were
sent for. Frederick received them with more than
his usual grace; but neither St. Arnaud nor Gavin
justly appreciated until then the true extent to
which this man should be feared. He said but
little of Dreisel; but the tones of his ringing
voice and the sombre fire that shone in his
steel-blue eyes would have made a braver man
than Dreisel tremble. Frederick did not long
dwell on the subject, which was necessarily a painful
and embarrassing one for him, and soon turned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>the conversation into lighter and more playful
channels.</p>

<p>“Bohlen tells me you wish to start very early
to-morrow morning,” he said to St. Arnaud. “I
can well believe that this young gentleman is a
vast responsibility. I wish to express to you the
pleasure I have had in the company of both, but
especially of Captain St. Arnaud. I fear that
history will say of me that I took no pleasure in
anything but beating my enemy in the field. How
great a mistake! I was formed for the pursuits
of a peaceful but not inactive life. The reorganization
of my country, the improvement of my people,
a steady progress of the arts and sciences, a
little recreation in the way of poetry and music,
and the society of accomplished men&mdash;these would
constitute my happiness. I have known but little
of it. Instead I spend my summers in the saddle
and my winters in planning for the summer
campaign. Did but the Empress Queen command
her armies in the field, as I do, she would make
peace with me forever.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud, not caring to discuss the only terms
on which Frederick would make peace, contented
himself with replying:</p>

<p>“The world, your Majesty, is loath to credit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>a man with more than one kind of excellence, and
because you are a master of the art of war, it will
always grudgingly admit what you have done or
might do in the arts of peace. I can, sire, tell you
truly, without the smallest flattery, that the hours
I have spent with your Majesty are among the
most valuable of my life; for I never failed to
learn something from you that I did not know
before.”</p>

<p>Frederick smiled graciously; he knew St. Arnaud
to be a sincere man, and that his phrases,
although courtier-like, were from an honest heart.
And when, as they shook hands cordially, St. Arnaud
said:</p>

<p>“And have I no message for the Prince of
Bevern?”</p>

<p>“None, but that I have received his letter, and
I am under great obligations to him for making
me acquainted with so agreeable a man as yourself.”</p>

<p>Gavin then advancing, Frederick said:</p>

<p>“Farewell. I have not had much speech with
you, but I perceive you to be no ordinary man.”</p>

<p>And Gavin, meaning to make a very conventional
and correct reply, said earnestly:</p>

<p>“Your Majesty, I have been in your company
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>now several times, and I never was ennuyéed for
one single moment when your Majesty was speaking!”</p>

<p>“Take care of him,” cried the King to St. Arnaud,
both of them laughing. “You have an
original there, and he may either be exiled or become
Prime Minister.”</p>

<p>The return journey to Vienna was made rapidly,
and on a pleasant spring night their travelling
chaise rattled up to the house in the Teinfeltstrasse.
They were received with open arms by
Lady Hamilton and Madame Ziska and her family.
St. Arnaud and Gavin had agreed to say
nothing for the present about Gavin’s little adventure
with Captain Dreisel, and Lady Hamilton
thought their journey had been one of unmixed
pleasure, except for the trifling accident to
Gavin’s leg.</p>

<p>Next morning they went to the palace, and were
summoned before the Empress Queen and the
Emperor. St. Arnaud gave an account of their
mission, together with the ill success of it for the
poor Prince of Bevern. Marie Theresa listened
with a scornful smile. Frederick of Prussia was
not only to her the enemy of her country, but an
object of the deepest personal dislike, and nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
good, in her opinion, could be expected of
him.</p>

<p>“The conduct of the King of Prussia in this
affair does not surprise me in the least,” she said;
“and so much was it expected by me, that, with
the Emperor’s consent, I had already determined
upon my course toward the Prince of Bevern. He
shall be released at once and allowed to return to
his country, with no condition beyond that of not
serving against us during the present war. If the
King of Prussia has no merciful impulses toward
his officers, who, though brave, may meet with
misfortunes, I and the Emperor feel much sympathy
for them; and we will do for the Prince of
Bevern what his own sovereign refuses to do.
Have you anything else of moment to tell me?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, madam, except an adventure of
Lieutenant Hamilton’s, which may interest you.”
And St. Arnaud, with inimitable archness, told
the story of Gavin’s bringing Frederick through
the flooded garden on his back, and the conversation
that ensued.</p>

<p>The Empress Queen and the Emperor laughed
so much that Gavin, who was very red and embarrassed
in the beginning, began to feel seriously
disconcerted. He recovered his good humour, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
when the Empress Queen desired to see
Frederick’s memorandum, and after reading it
cried:</p>

<p>“I cannot do less than the King of Prussia expects.
You shall have two steps in promotion instead
of one!” At which Gavin only blushed the
more while stammering out his thanks.</p>

<p>When, a few moments after, St. Arnaud and
Gavin left the Empress Queen’s closet, St. Arnaud
whispered:</p>

<p>“The release of poor Bevern is caused by two
motives&mdash;one, to benefit a brave but unfortunate
man; the other, to chagrin the King of Prussia.”</p>

<p>The next succeeding weeks were entirely different
from those which had preceded the Breslau
expedition. The spring campaign was about to
open, and court and people were absorbed in
preparations for trying the fortunes of war once
more with Frederick. St. Arnaud was busy all
day and all night with the affairs of his corps.
It had been in cantonments on the outskirts of
Vienna during the winter, and was to march the
middle of April. Gavin’s duties as a subaltern
compelled him to take up his quarters with his regiment,
and he occupied alone the tent that was to shelter
St. Arnaud and himself on the march. He applied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>himself more seriously to the study of military
affairs from the point of an officer, and in this, as
in everything he had tried to study in his life, he
had much assistance from his mother. She got
him books in English and French, and helped
him in his fluent but somewhat incorrect German.
Nor were his creature comforts forgotten, although
Lady Hamilton never ceased to impress upon him
that the equipment of his mind must always come
before the considerations for his body. Nevertheless,
he was well supplied with many little comforts
for the campaign which had been unknown
to him before.</p>

<p>Every day he came to the Teinfeltstrasse house
to visit his mother, if only for a few minutes, and
to see his cherished friends, Madame Ziska and her
family. It was arranged that Lady Hamilton
should remain with her excellent friends until
Gavin could return to Vienna&mdash;if ever he returned.
Gavin, however, had perfect confidence in his own
return, for his nature was sanguine to the last degree,
and it was always as surprising as it was unpleasant
for things to go wrong with him. Having
escaped hanging by a very narrow margin only
gave him increased confidence in the future&mdash;a
thing very conducive to both happiness and success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>He did not again see his father, and really did
not know whether Sir Gavin Hamilton was still in
Vienna or not. Gavin’s duties kept him so closely
with his troop, that he no longer had time to frequent
palaces or drawing-rooms, and it was not always
easy for him to see his mother once a day.
St. Arnaud was equally busy, and their thoughts
and their talk were all about the coming campaign.
They congratulated themselves daily upon being
under General Loudon, the most adventurous of
men, and the making the campaign with each other
was peculiarly gratifying to both.</p>

<p>Daily were they expecting orders to march.
Marshal Daun had begun the concentration of his
army at Koniggratz the middle of March, and the
light troops under General Loudon were expected
to be on the move to join him by the middle of
April. It was known that General Loudon was
to come to Vienna to receive the Military Order
of Maria Theresa&mdash;the highest military order in
the Empire, and one justly earned by General
Loudon&mdash;and after spending one day there, he
was to accompany the very last brigade to Leutomischl,
about fifty miles from Olmutz. Each day
detachments were dispatched, but St. Arnaud’s and
Gavin’s regiments were not among them. It began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
to be whispered abroad that their regiment
would have the honour of escorting the major-general
himself.</p>

<p>One day, as Gavin was toiling over a muddy
road, at the head of his troop of hussars, which
had been going through the sword exercise, he
met St. Arnaud galloping along alone. He rode
up to Gavin, and called out loud enough for the
men to hear:</p>

<p>“By the day after to-morrow we shall be on the
march. Not half a mile behind me rides General
Loudon, and when he comes to Vienna it is for
as short a time as he can stay; and then he goes
off like a shot, hunting for Prussians.”</p>

<p>The men exchanged glances of pleasure, and
Gavin, bringing the detachment down to a slow
trot, and talking with St. Arnaud, presently heard
the thunder of hoofs behind them. He looked
back, and there, coming along the highroad, still
muddy from the spring rains, was a small cavalry
escort, and in front rode a tall, spare, red-haired
man, whom he surmised to be the celebrated General
Loudon.</p>

<p>Gavin, drawing his men up on the side of the
road, placed himself slightly in advance of them,
with St. Arnaud. As General Loudon came up,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>he stopped and courteously saluted both officers and
men, the latter raising a hearty cheer as he approached.
St. Arnaud then introduced Gavin,
pronouncing his name much better than Gavin
could.</p>

<p>“Hamilton!” said General Loudon. “That is
a Scotch and also an English name. How comes
Lieutenant Hamilton in my command?”</p>

<p>“It is a long story, sir,” responded Gavin;
“but, like yourself, although I am of Scotch and
English blood, I am a true soldier, if not a born
subject, of the Empress Queen.”</p>

<p>General Loudon then made a few remarks; but
his manner, though polite, was awkward, and he
had by no means the graceful self-possession of
St. Arnaud or the pleasant assurance of Gavin
Hamilton.</p>

<p>When he had ridden on St. Arnaud said to
Gavin:</p>

<p>“Do you see how cold, how awkward, how slow
he is? That man under fire becomes animated,
quicker than lightning, even graceful. It has been
said that he grows actually handsome in the light
of battle.”</p>

<p>“He looks like a Calvinist minister with dyspepsia,”
was Gavin’s comment; nevertheless, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>knew very well General Loudon’s reputation as
the most dashing leader of light troops in Europe.</p>

<p>As soon as General Loudon’s arrival was known
in Vienna, it was understood that the opening of
the campaign was at hand, and there was the stir
and excitement of the actual beginning of warlike
events. The announcement was made that the Empress
Queen would invest him with her great military
order on the evening of the next day, and the
morning after, at sunrise, he would be on the march
for Leutomischl, with the last of the hussar regiments.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud and Gavin were in a fever of
preparation all that day and the next; but a duty,
not to be omitted, was their presence at the palace
in the evening to see the bestowal of this splendid
decoration on their commander. The Empress
Queen, consonant with her lofty and unquenchable
spirit, had commanded a splendid levee on the
occasion, that she might show to all the world the
courage and high hopes with which she renewed
the struggle.</p>

<p>Never had Gavin more admired his mother’s
courage than during those last two days. Smiling,
hopeful, encouraging, she bore the terrible heartache
of parting, but she did not wholly hide it, even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>from Gavin. For himself, he went to war as he
went to a festival. He was distressed at the
thought of his mother, but he was too wholly confident
of returning to her to seriously grieve.</p>

<p>“Do this for me, mother&mdash;go with me to the
palace to-night; let me have the satisfaction of
showing you to all those people, and, besides, it
will divert you and make you forget that I am
leaving to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” murmured Lady Hamilton.</p>

<p>“And as for meeting my father, I think he must
have left Vienna. No one has seen him for a
month.”</p>

<p>“Then I will go; perhaps the being with you
a few hours longer may be an inducement,” replied
his mother in a gayer tone.</p>

<p>“It is every one’s duty, mother, to look gay to-night;
for if we meet the Prussians with downcast
hearts, we are already half beaten.”</p>

<p>“Quite true. And as I am the daughter of a
soldier, and was the sister of soldiers, as well as
the mother of a soldier, I shall be as brave as any.
But let me tell you, Gavin, the bravest at the levee
to-night will not be the men wearing their swords,
but the women who with anxious hearts and trembling
souls give their best beloved to their country.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>
<p>Madame Ziska and Kalenga were to sit up until
the return of the party from the palace, and they
were to have a farewell supper together, for St.
Arnaud and Gavin must be with their troops before
daybreak.</p>

<p>Madame Ziska and little Freda assisted Lady
Hamilton with her toilet&mdash;the same severely simple
black satin gown she had worn before. The
two women understood and mutually comforted
each other, and by tacit agreement there was no
mention of the impending parting until just as
Lady Hamilton was ready, and stood a picture of
mature and womanly grace, Madame Ziska began
to weep.</p>

<p>“I am a fool,” she cried. “They will come
back&mdash;I know they will come back&mdash;but it is hard
to let them go, for I, too, love them dearly.”</p>

<p>At this Freda suddenly burst into loud weeping.
The mother remained dry-eyed.</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” she said, “there will be time
enough for tears. To-night I will not show, so
much as by the quiver of an eyelash, the pain and
fear that are gnawing at me.”</p>

<p>At that moment they heard Gavin and St. Arnaud
in the next room. Madame Ziska quickly
dried her eyes, gently pushed the weeping Freda
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>out of sight and hearing in the corridor, and appeared
smiling calmly before Gavin and St. Arnaud.</p>

<p>“Now, this is what I wish to see,” cried Gavin&mdash;“a
pleasant parting, without any tears or fears.
There is no doubt about it, we go to beat the Prussians;
we will return with increased rank and
decorations, and we will be saying among ourselves,
‘How sensible it was to part gayly as we
did!’”</p>

<p>“Quite true,” said his mother, smiling, and taking
St. Arnaud’s arm to lead her to the coach, while
Gavin lingered to say a gay farewell to Madame
Ziska, and to call Freda, who remained weeping
and invisible on the landing of the back stairs.</p>

<p>In a little while they were at the palace, where
a great crowd of persons, military and civil, had
assembled to do honour to the army, through General
Loudon. Kaunitz was there, superbly dressed
as usual, with his eagle eye fixed on the French
ambassador, to make sure that he noted the loyalty
and enthusiasm of all present. The young archdukes
and archduchesses, from the Crown Prince,
a handsome young man of seventeen, standing behind
his mother’s chair, down to the pretty little
princesses, with their governesses, grouped in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>gallery overlooking the splendid scene, were all
present.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud and Gavin with Lady Hamilton secured
a good place of observation in the grand
salon, where the ceremony of bestowing the order
was to take place. The Empress Queen and the
Emperor sat in gilded arm-chairs upon the same
daïs that they had occupied at the first royal levee
Gavin had attended. The Empress Queen looked
even more superb than Gavin had yet seen her.
Fearful as had been the blows that had befallen
her armies, she was ready again, with lion-like
courage, to meet her ancient enemy. Every heart
in Austria and Hungary might grow faint, but
Maria Theresa knew not what fear meant. She
was talking with great animation to those around
her, with her fine, expressive eyes flashing, and
her full, red lips wreathed in smiles. When danger
was at hand, then was she most full of vivid
life. The Emperor at her side showed equal cheerfulness.
Occasionally, the Empress Queen would
turn to him and make a smiling remark, to which
he would respond in kind. At length, a hush fell
upon the company; General Loudon had entered
the hall. He was entirely unaccompanied, and
dressed in a very splendid uniform. Immediately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>way was made for him, and he proceeded up the
aisle thus formed to the daïs. At the sight of his
countenance an involuntary smile went around.
His naturally rugged features looked still more
homely under the embarrassment of so much
notice. He ambled along with the utmost awkwardness,
glanced around desperately when he
reached the foot of the daïs, as if looking for a
place to run away; and when the Empress Queen,
with her characteristic grace, pinned the magnificent
decoration on his breast, he almost fell over
the royal footstool in his attempt to kneel and kiss
her hand.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” whispered St. Arnaud. “Wait
until you see him leading the charge up a hill, with
Prussians well posted at the top. He never falters
or palters then, nor falls over anything, nor looks
around to see if there is any chance of running
away.”</p>

<p>The air of hope and encouragement worn by
the Empress Queen was infectious. All were under
the influence of excitement, and it brought
brightness to the eyes and a ringing echo to the
voices of all. Never had Gavin passed a gayer
evening, nor had St. Arnaud. As for Lady Hamilton,
many mothers and wives and sisters were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>present who were no less brave than she; but if
she had been asked to name one of the periods of
most exquisite misery in her life, it would have
been the night of that brilliant levee, when, with
a head proudly erect and a smiling face, she walked
through the stately splendours of a palace.</p>

<p>Before midnight they were home again. Madame
Ziska had a delicious supper waiting for
them, and Kalenga’s chair was already drawn up
to the table. Amid laughter and toasts and the
most dazzling anticipations, on Gavin’s part, of
the campaign, an hour was passed. Then they
heard the tramping of horses at the door, as the
orderly brought them trotting down the stony
street.</p>

<p>The children were supposed to be in bed, as
Gavin and St. Arnaud were giving some last messages
and little presents for them, when a door
opened, and Freda and Gretchen, with the two
boys, all fully dressed, walked in.</p>

<p>“We knew you were going away,” cried Freda,
trying not to cry; “so after we had been put to
bed we agreed to get up and dress ourselves when
you came home from the levee&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;”</p>

<p>Freda broke down, immediately followed by
Gretchen and the two little boys, who considered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>it a mark of affection for Gavin and St. Arnaud
to bawl at the top of their lungs. The two departing
ones hastily kissed the children all around, and
Gavin was forced to gently disentangle Freda’s
arms from about his neck; and wringing Kalenga’s
hand, they went to the door, accompanied by Lady
Hamilton and Madame Ziska. Farewells, heartfelt,
but silent and swift, were exchanged, and a
moment after, when Gavin and St. Arnaud were
clattering down the street, Gavin said in a low
voice:</p>

<p>“The Prussians cannot make us suffer more
than in parting from those we love. That last kiss
of my mother’s&mdash;oh, St. Arnaud, I can never,
never forget it!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> sunrise, on a beautiful April morning, the
last detachment of General Loudon’s light troops,
five thousand strong, took up their march to join
the army of Marshal Daun.</p>

<p>Every officer and man wore in his helmet a sprig
of green, according to an ancient custom of the
Austrian army when beginning a campaign. Vast
crowds assembled at every point of vantage along
the highway to applaud these favourite troops;
while, afar off, the steeples, towers, and belfries of
Vienna were black with people watching as this
splendid body of men unwound itself, like a great
serpent, and turned its head toward the enemy.</p>

<p>Gavin felt triumphantly happy as his troop, well
horsed and clad, fell in line. They were mostly
new recruits, with a sprinkling of seasoned soldiers,
but they had had several months of breaking
in at the cantonments, and being originally of stout
fibre&mdash;honest peasantry, used to an outdoor life of
toil&mdash;they were already fair soldiers. If every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>one of them did not burn with enthusiasm, as
Gavin did, to distinguish himself, they had a fine
and noble <i>esprit de corps</i>, which rendered it certain
that every man would do his duty to his sovereign
and his country.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud, as captain, had more liberty in his
movements on the march than Gavin; but Gavin,
riding along contentedly at the head of his troop,
was well entertained by his own thoughts.</p>

<p>“If I expect promotion,” he argued to himself,
“I ought to show by the condition of the men under
me how I could manage a larger body. Now,
having been a private soldier myself, I know exactly
what these fellows will do and will not do.
They will not, at first, know how to make themselves
comfortable; but I, who went through two
campaigns, know a thing or two about that. Then,
when a man is ill, if he is a brave fellow, he will
make out that he is well, and won’t go to the hospital;
but I will look sharp after him and see that he
does. The faint-hearted ones will imagine they are
ill every time things look a little blue. Aha! I
shall catch those fellows. I will have my men so
that St. Arnaud will say to the major: ‘Do you
notice Lieutenant Hamilton’s troop? Always
ninety-nine per cent. of them fit for duty.’ Then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>the major, reporting to the lieutenant-colonel, will
say: ‘Do you observe Lieutenant Hamilton’s excellent
report?’ And the lieutenant-colonel, talking
with the colonel, will say: ‘Lieutenant Hamilton’s
troop is the best in St. Arnaud’s command,
and St. Arnaud’s command is the best in the regiment.’
And the colonel, one day, as we file past,
will say to General Loudon: ‘Will your Excellency
notice Captain St. Arnaud’s command, how well
it looks and marches?’ And General Loudon will
reply: ‘True; and Lieutenant Hamilton’s troop is
the best of them.’ And so, when promotions are
going, it will be said: ‘St. Arnaud and that young
Hamilton must not be left out.’ Oh, what a stroke
of good fortune it was that I got lost in the snow
in Silesia!”</p>

<p>When they halted for the night, Gavin made
good all he had said concerning his knowledge of
how to make his men comfortable. His troopers,
seeing this intimate knowledge of their wants, and
that they were attended to before their young lieutenant
looked after his own comfort, conceived an
instant respect for him. After he had seen that
both men and horses were provided for, Gavin hastened
to the tent to be shared in common by St.
Arnaud and himself. St. Arnaud had been equally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>zealous in the performance of his duty, and it was
more onerous than Gavin’s. But presently he arrived;
their servant had provided them with a
good supper, and they spent their first evening of
campaigning with the greatest merriment.</p>

<p>Those days of marching toward Marshal Daun
were to Gavin very happy. He loved a soldier’s
life, and when he had bright spring weather and
mild April nights, with the comforts of an officer
on the march, he had nothing else to ask for in life
except promotion.</p>

<p>They reached the neighbourhood of Leutomischl
within a few days, and found an army of fifty
thousand men assembled, mostly raw recruits, with
the remnants of the men who had made the disastrous
autumn campaign. Forty miles off lay Frederick
of Prussia, with forty thousand men, besieging
Olmutz. If he succeeded in capturing this
strongly fortified place the road to Vienna would
be open. But it was an undertaking difficult for
even the stupendous military genius of Frederick.
The town was naturally protected by the numerous
branches of the Morawa River, and these sluices,
generally kept dammed, could easily be flooded
and oppose difficult obstacles to overcome. In addition
to this, all of the Prussian supplies&mdash;food,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>ammunition, and money&mdash;had to be transported by
wagons from Neisse, a hundred and twenty miles
off, while the last eighty miles from Troppau were
extremely dangerous, and required a protecting
force of more than ten thousand men for each of
the monthly convoys of from three to four thousand
four-horse wagons.</p>

<p>Marshal Daun was proverbial for his slowness
and caution, and it was often a source of congratulation
to Gavin and St. Arnaud that they were under
General Loudon, who was in a state of perpetual
activity. There were continual scouting
parties almost to the gates of Olmutz, and constant
communication with the town and garrison. Both
were determined to resist, and being well provided
with food and ammunition, there was no thought
of surrender. Frederick, who is thought to have
shown less ability in sieges than in battles, had
allowed his engineers to begin their first parallel
too far away from the lines, and the first bombardment,
terrific in point of noise, and costing vast
amounts of the gunpowder so precious to the Prussians,
did not the smallest harm.</p>

<p>The month of May opened, and although Frederick
pursued the siege with vigour, Marshal Daun
still lay among the hills and mountains, moving a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>little off from Leutomischl, but still keeping about
forty miles from Olmutz. He knew, however, that
all was going well for the Austrians and ill for the
Prussians at Olmutz. The Pandours, light-armed
Hungarian infantry, that in marching could equal
the cavalry, infested the neighbourhood of the town
and fortress in small parties, and even singly,
while Loudon’s corps, chiefly light cavalry, but
with four regiments of grenadiers, made it dangerous
to all small bodies of Prussian troops who ventured
away from their lines. Loudon’s comprehensive
and piercing eye did not fail to see the
qualifications of all his officers, even the subalterns,
whom he knew through the reports he exacted
of their superiors, and he soon came to realize
that in Captain St. Arnaud he had a man after
his own heart. And riding one day with the
colonel of St. Arnaud’s regiment, the general
said:</p>

<p>“Is not that young Sublieutenant Hamilton,
who is always with Captain St. Arnaud, a capable
officer?”</p>

<p>“Very, sir; his activity and enterprise, as well
as Captain St. Arnaud’s, were shown by their escape
from Glatz. As you probably know, Hamilton
is of good English and Scotch blood, but, owing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>to some family troubles, his youth was spent in
poverty and obscurity, and he served some time
in the French army as a private soldier. The Empress
Queen herself gave him his commission, and
the young man seems burning to distinguish himself.”</p>

<p>General Loudon, himself a Scotchman, was not
less interested in Gavin from knowing his nationality.</p>

<p>May passed into June, and June waned; still
Marshal Daun gave no sign of interrupting the
siege of Olmutz. He had merely taken up a position
a few miles nearer, where he patiently waited
for the hour of action. The officers and men of
Loudon’s corps were envied by the rest of the army,
as they alone were actively employed.</p>

<p>One night, after a week of very active scouting,
St. Arnaud and Gavin were sitting in their tent,
when a message from General Loudon came for
St. Arnaud. He at once left, and it was an hour
before he returned. When he entered, his gleaming
eyes and smiling face showed that he had something
pleasant to tell.</p>

<p>“Good news! great news!” he said, sitting down
on the table, where Gavin was studying a large
map of the country spread out before him. “We
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>move to-morrow. A wagon train of more than
three thousand four-horse wagons, loaded with
money, food, clothing, and ammunition&mdash;they say
our old acquaintance, the King of Prussia, is devilish
short of ammunition&mdash;has started from Neisse.
If it reaches Olmutz, it will prolong the siege certainly&mdash;Frederick
thinks it will give him the victory.
But if we can stop it, we can save Olmutz
without a pitched battle, and thereby ruin the
Prussian campaign in the beginning. It has an
escort of seven thousand men, and four thousand
men will be sent to meet it; that means that the
Prussians must lose a whole army corps, as well
as their three or four thousand wagons and twelve
thousand horses.”</p>

<p>“And we will stop them here,” cried Gavin,
excitably, pointing on the map to the pass of Domstadtl.
“You know, that pass, hemmed in by
mountains, and narrow and devious, a thousand
men could stop ten thousand there.”</p>

<p>“We will make a feint at Guntersdorf, a few
miles before they get to Domstadtl; but you are
right; the Prussians must open that gate and shut
it after them if they want to save their convoy;
and the opening and shutting will be hard enough,
I promise you. We move the day after to-morrow,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>so go to bed. You will have work to do to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Work, indeed, there was to do for every officer
and man in Marshal Daun’s army; and the morning
after they were on the march. It was a bright
and beautiful June morning, and it seemed a holiday
march to the fifty thousand Austrians. Marshal
Daun was noted for keeping his men well
fed, and the friendly disposition of the people in
the province made this an easy thing to do. The
Austrian armies were ever the most picturesque
in Europe, owing to the splendour and variety of
their uniforms and the different races represented.
Rested and refreshed after the disastrous campaign
of the autumn, on this day they hailed with joy
the prospect of meeting their ancient enemy.
With fresh twigs in their helmets, with their knapsacks
well filled, the great masses of cavalry, infantry,
and artillery stepped out in beautiful order,
threading their way along the breezy uplands
and through the green heart of the wooded hills
down to the charming valleys below.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud and Gavin were with the vanguard.
A part of their duty was to throw a reinforcement
of eleven hundred men into Olmutz, and it was
Marshal Daun’s design to make Frederick think
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>that a pitched battle in front of Olmutz was designed.</p>

<p>All through the dewy morning they travelled
briskly, and after a short rest at noon they again
took up the line of march in the golden afternoon.
About six o’clock they reached a little white village
in the plain, which was to be the halting place
for the night of Loudon’s corps.</p>

<p>It was an exquisite June evening, cool for the
season, with a young moon trembling in the east,
and a sky all green and rose and opal in the west.
Myriads of flashing stars glittered in the deep blue
heavens, and the passing from the golden light of
day to the silver radiance of the night was ineffably
lovely.</p>

<p>From the vast green plain and the dusky hills
and valleys rose the camp-fires of fifty thousand
men. Just at sunset the band of St. Arnaud’s
regiment, marching out to a green field beyond the
village, began to play the national hymn. Other
bands, from the near-by plain and the far-away
recesses of the hills and valleys, joined in, and the
music, deliciously softened by the distances, floated
upward, till it was lost in the evening sky.</p>

<p>Gavin and St. Arnaud, walking together along a
little hawthorn-bordered lane, listened with a feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
of delight so sharp as to be almost pain. The
magic beauty of the scene, the hour, and the sweet
music were overpowering. St. Arnaud’s words,
after a long silence, when the last echo of the music
had died among the hills, were:</p>

<p>“And this delicious prelude is the beginning of
the great concert of war, cannon, and musketry,
the groans and cries of the wounded, the wild weeping
of widows and orphans, the tap of the drum in
the funeral march.”</p>

<p>“And shouts of victory, and the knowledge of
having done one’s duty, and the sweet acclaims of
all we love when we return,” answered Gavin.</p>

<p>“I am older than you, and have seen more of
war,” was St. Arnaud’s reply.</p>

<p>Day broke next morning upon a fair and cloudless
world. It continued cool for the season, and
the sun was not too warm to drive away the freshness
of the air. By sunrise they were on the
march again, and by noon Frederick, at his great
camp of Prossnitz, saw through his glass masses of
Austrians appearing through the trees and taking
post on the opposite heights, and turning to his
aide, said:</p>

<p>“Those Austrians are learning to march,
though!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>In the Prussian army it was thought that battle
was meant, and troops were hurried forward
to that side of the fortress. But Loudon, stealthily
creeping up on the other side, engaging such force
as was left&mdash;eleven hundred grenadiers&mdash;without
firing a shot or losing a man double-quicked it
into the fortress. By the afternoon the Austrians
had melted out of sight, and the garrison was
stronger by eleven hundred men.</p>

<p>In this demonstration on the other side of the
fortress St. Arnaud’s command had taken part.
It was well understood that the action was a mere
feint to cover the grenadiers who were running
into the fortress, and St. Arnaud had privately
warned Gavin against leading his troop too far,
knowing that a single troop may bring on a general
engagement. Gavin promised faithfully to
remember this, and did, until finding himself, for
the first time, close to a small body of Prussian
infantry, in an old apple orchard, he suddenly
dashed forward, waving his sword frantically, and
yelling for his men to come on. The Prussians were
not to be frightened by that sort of thing, and
coolly waiting, partly protected by the trees and
undergrowth, received the Austrians with a volley.
One trooper rolled out of his saddle; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>sight maddened the rest, and the first thing St.
Arnaud knew he was in the midst of a sharp
skirmish. The Prussians stood their ground, and
as the Austrians had no infantry at hand, it took
some time to dislodge them. Nor was it done
without loss on the Austrian side. At last, however,
the Prussians began a backward movement,
in perfect order, and without losing a man. St.
Arnaud, glad to have them go on almost any terms,
was amazed and infuriated to hear Gavin shouting
to his men, and to see them following him at a
gallop, under the trees, toward the wall at the
farther end of the orchard, where the Prussians
could ask no better place to make a stand. In
vain the bugler rent the air with the piercing notes
of the recall. Gavin only turned, and waving his
sword at St. Arnaud plunged ahead. St. Arnaud,
wild with anxiety, sent an orderly after him with
peremptory orders to return; but Gavin kept on.
St. Arnaud, sending a number of his men around
in an effort to flank the Prussians, was presently
relieved to see some of Gavin’s troopers straggling
back. And last of all he saw Gavin, with a man
lying across the rump of his horse, making his way
out of the orchard. At that moment General Loudon,
with a single staff-officer, rode up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“Captain St. Arnaud,” said he in a voice of
suppressed anger, “I am amazed at what I see.
If this firing is heard, it may bring the Prussians
on our backs in such force that not only our grenadiers
will not get into the fortress, but they may be
captured. My orders were, distinctly, there should
be no fighting, if possible. Here I see a part of
your command following the enemy into a position
where a hundred of them could hold their own
against a thousand cavalry.”</p>

<p>St. Arnaud was in a rage with Gavin, and thinking
it would be the best thing in the world for
Gavin to get then and there the rebuke he deserved,
replied firmly:</p>

<p>“It is not I, sir, who has disobeyed your orders.
Lieutenant Hamilton’s impetuosity led him into
this, and I have been trying to recall him for the
last half hour. Here is Lieutenant Hamilton
now.”</p>

<p>Gavin rode up. An overhanging bough had
grazed his nose and made it bleed, and at the same
time had given him a black and swollen eye. And
another bough had caught in his coat and torn it
nearly off his body. But these minor particulars
were lost in the vast and expansive grin which
wreathed his face. The thought that illumined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>his mind and emblazoned his countenance was
this:</p>

<p>“The general is here. He must have seen what
I did. What good fortune! My promotion is
sure.”</p>

<p>But what General Loudon said was this:</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Hamilton, your conduct to-day is
as much deserving of a court martial as any I ever
saw on the field. You have not only unnecessarily
endangered the lives of your men&mdash;a crime on the
part of an officer&mdash;but you have come near endangering
the whole success of our movement. Your
place after this will be with neither the vanguard
nor the rear-guard, but with the main body, where
you can do as little harm by your rashness as possible.”</p>

<p>Gavin’s look of triumph changed to one of utter
bewilderment, and then to one of mingled rage and
horror. General Loudon, without another word,
rode off. Gavin, half choking, cried to St. Arnaud:</p>

<p>“But you know what I went after? My first
sergeant was shot through both legs&mdash;the fellow
was in the lead&mdash;and he cried out to me to come
and save him. Just then I heard the bugle, but
could I leave that poor fellow there to die?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>“Certainly not; and this shall be known; but
you were very rash in the beginning; so come on,
and wash your face the first time you come to
water.”</p>

<p>The rest of that day was like an unhappy dream
to Gavin. They were again on the march by three
o’clock, and at bivouac they had rejoined the main
body.</p>

<p>Their camp that night was well beyond Olmutz,
and led them again toward the mountains. When
all the arrangements for the night were made, and
their tent was pitched, St. Arnaud, who had been
absent for half an hour, returned and looked in.
He saw Gavin sitting on the ground in an attitude
of utter dejection.</p>

<p>“Come,” cried St. Arnaud gayly; “you take
the general too seriously; he was angry with you,
and so was I, for that matter; but he knows all
the facts now.”</p>

<p>“It is of no consequence,” replied Gavin sullenly.
But when St. Arnaud urged him, he rose and
joined him for a stroll about the camp. As they
were walking along a little path that led along
the face of a ravine, they saw, in the clear twilight
of the June evening, General Loudon, quite unattended,
approaching them. Gavin would have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>turned off, but St. Arnaud would not let him. As
they stood on the side of the path, respectfully
to let the general pass, he stopped and said in the
rather awkward way which was usual with him:</p>

<p>“I make no apology for my words to you to-day,
Lieutenant Hamilton, because, on cool reflection,
I still think that you deserve them. I found out,
however, later, that you performed an act of great
gallantry in rescuing your wounded sergeant, and
I have already recommended you for promotion
to Marshal Daun.”</p>

<p>General Loudon extended his hand. Gavin,
quite overcome, took it silently, and after a cordial
grasp and a word or two between St. Arnaud and
General Loudon he passed on.</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> told him,” was all Gavin could say to
St. Arnaud.</p>

<p>“What if I did? I was bound to tell him all
that happened before his report was sent to Marshal
Daun.”</p>

<p>The day had been a nightmare, but the night
was so happy that Gavin could not sleep.</p>

<p>From the 22d until the 28th Loudon’s corps was
travelling toward the convoy by a long and circuitous
hill route, quite out of sight and knowledge
of the Prussians. Marshal Daun had remained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>behind with the main body, having crossed the
Moldawa River, while General Ziskowitz, with
several thousand men, remained on the other side,
ready to reinforce General Loudon, should he be
needed.</p>

<p>Those six June days were cloudless, and what
with easy marching and mild nights and good fare,
never was campaigning pleasanter. Their march
lay among the hills and mountains, clothed in their
freshest green. Pure and sparkling streams
abounded in the wooded heights and cool, green
solitudes. The oldest soldiers declared it to be the
pleasantest march they had ever made.</p>

<p>On the sixth day they began to listen attentively
for the noise of the approaching convoy, which,
with its escort, was stretched out full twenty miles.
Soon after daybreak, as the Austrians were pushing
toward the woody defiles near Guntersdorf, a
low reverberation was heard, like the far-distant
echo of breakers on the shore. It was the rolling
of twelve thousand iron-bound wheels, while the
iron-shod hoofs of twelve thousand horses smote
the earth. General Loudon immediately made his
preparations to attack at Guntersdorf, but it was
understood that if a determined resistance was
made the Austrians should fall back to Domstadtl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
through whose dark defiles and gloomy
passes it would be impossible for the Prussians to
fight their way.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud’s regiment led the van, and he and
Gavin rode side by side through the dewy freshness
of the morning. The road was steep and
winding, but always picturesque, and the trees
were in their first fresh livery of green. They rode
briskly, men and horses inspired by the freshness
and vitality of the delicious mountain air. Ever
as they drew nearer the road by which the convoy
was making its creaking, rolling, thundering way,
the sullen roar grew nearer and louder. On reaching
Guntersdorf, General Loudon quickly posted a
part of his force in the defiles, with several pieces
of artillery concealed among the wooded heights.
The general rode hither and thither, and presently
came up to where St. Arnaud’s and Gavin’s
regiment was posted, on the brow of a spur of the
mountains, thick with trees and rocks.</p>

<p>“We shall meet the advance guard and escort
here; it is probably three thousand men, with
seven or eight thousand to follow; but if we throw
them into confusion and overwhelm them, it will
be enough. It is impossible to stop at once a wagon
train twenty miles long, and the wagons will help
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>us to win the battle, by those behind pressing those
in front upon our guns. Then we shall fall back
to Domstadtl, where we can destroy the convoy at
our leisure.”</p>

<p>At that moment, from their commanding position,
St. Arnaud and Gavin looked across a low-lying
flank of the mountains, and winding across
a valley, four miles away, were a thousand Prussian
dragoons, while behind them came a long line
of infantry, and then the great wagon train, four
abreast.</p>

<p>Never had either Gavin or St. Arnaud seen such
a sight as this vast mass of men, horses, and
wagons that poured in a steady stream into the
valley. The earth shook with the mighty tramp,
and great clouds of dust enveloped them like a
fog.</p>

<p>The stillness of the early June morning remained
unbroken for an hour; yet while this
strange procession unwound itself and approached
nearer and nearer the defiles of Guntersdorf the
noise became deafening, and the horses of the Austrian
cavalry trembled with fear as the earth shook
under their feet. Presently, the first platoon of
Prussian cavalry debouched before an Austrian
field battery, concealed in the heights above them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>Suddenly the thunderous roar of wheels and hoofs
was cut into by the booming of guns, and cannon-balls
dropped among the troopers. Instantly there
was a halt, the infantry closed up, and under a
heavy fire the Prussians formed and rushed up the
heights to silence the guns. The Austrians stood
their ground, supported by both cavalry and infantry;
but meanwhile the wagons were fighting
the battle for them. In vain had orders been sent
back to halt the train. It came pressing on with an
irresistible force, like the force of gravity. The
Austrians, seeing the beginning of hopeless confusion
and panic in the wagon train, which
could only increase, drew off, inducing the Prussians
to follow them. There was some sharp fighting
among the passes, but, as Gavin said, just as
he was beginning to enjoy himself the order came
to fall back to Domstadtl.</p>

<p>It was about eight o’clock in the morning when
the Austrians began to retrace the road they had
travelled soon after daybreak. St. Arnaud’s and
Gavin’s regiment, having had the van in the advance,
were the rear-guard of the retrograde movement.
As they trotted along behind the last rank
of troopers, they both cast many backward looks
at the rude mountain roads through which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>Prussians were toiling to their destruction in the
impenetrable ravines of Domstadtl. The troops
had reformed as well as they could, but the wagons
were in a terrible state of disorder. Some hundreds
of them had stopped at Guntersdorf, but
these had been swept away and trampled under
foot by the advancing legions. Some of the wagoners
had turned their vehicles around and were
making for the rear, knowing fighting to be ahead
of them; others, cutting the traces, mounted the
horses and galloped no one knew whither, leaving
a solid barricade of wagons in the road to be dispersed.
And ever from behind came this avalanche
of horses and wagons, pressing on, halting
at obstacles, scattered in dire confusion, but
always, always, a stream pouring on.</p>

<p>The Austrians reached the gloomy pass of Domstadtl
only a little in advance of the Prussians,
and before they had well taken their positions and
unlimbered their artillery the Prussian vanguard,
very gallantly led, had forced its way through the
pass, with two hundred and fifty wagons on the
gallop. But then came the howling of the Austrian
artillery, and the advance was checked. Colonel
Mosel, the Prussian commander, seeing there
was no forcing the pass, formed all his wagons
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>as fast as they arrived in a great square&mdash;a wagon
fortress, as it was called&mdash;and prepared to defend
it. General Zeithen, with the guard for the second
section, moved rapidly backward to turn the
great stream of men and horses and wheels back
on Troppau. But still they came surging on, men
losing their heads, and driving forward when they
were ordered to turn backward. And on the wagon
fortress played the Austrian artillery, while the
cavalry, dashing up to the remnants of the Prussian
guard, sabred them at the wagons. The
wagon horses grew wild with fright, and their
plunging, rearing, and frantic whinnying added
to the maelstrom of disorder. The powder wagons
were in this division, and when an Austrian cannon-ball
fell into one of these, the explosion seemed
as if it would rend the solid mountains. Others
caught from the sparks of this one, and the scene
and sound, as deafening crashes resounded, and
masses of flame and smoke ascended, were like the
infernal regions. Huge rocks, split by the concussion
of thousands of pounds of gunpowder, rolled
down the sides of the mountain, sweeping away
men and horses in their resistless course. Uprooted
trees and a vast mass of debris followed
these awful reverberations. Horses dropped dead
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>in their tracks, men fell to the ground, stunned by
the roar, and were unable to rise; others bled at
the nose; some became totally deaf. The sky was
obscured with smoke, and in the semi-darkness at
midday men’s faces, blackened with powder, had a
frightful appearance. Fighting continued at all
points along the line, where the eleven thousand
Prussians endeavoured to make a stand at many
places, but were completely overborne. Cannon
and musketry added their horrors to the scene, and
when men fought at all they fought like demons.
All through the June day this fearful combat
raged through the mountain passes; and when the
sun, obscured in dim clouds, set, the great wagon
train was utterly destroyed, with thousands of its
escort, wagoners, and horses dead.</p>

<p>Neither St. Arnaud nor Gavin slept in a tent
that night, but throwing themselves on the ground,
wrapped in their cloaks, slept the sleep of exhaustion
and collapse.</p>

<p>By sunset Frederick of Prussia knew that his
convoy was destroyed, and with it some of his best
troops. That night the bombardment of Olmutz
was terrific; the Prussians were firing off the
ammunition they could not take away with
them. No one slept in the town or the fortress
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>that night for the hurricane of fire and flame that
blazed from the Prussian lines. It slackened
toward daylight, and when the sun rose there was
not a Prussian regiment in sight. The whole
army was on the march for the other side of the
mountains.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> abandonment of the siege of Olmutz and
the success of the Battle of the Wagons raised to
a high pitch the spirits of the Austrian army.
Marshal Daun even departed so far from his usual
extreme caution as to follow Frederick, who retreated
through the mountains, and took up his
post upon his own side of them. But he was not
suffered to remain in peace, and was continually
harassed by the Austrian cavalry and the clouds
of Pandours, who followed and hung upon him.</p>

<p>To be of Loudon’s corps was enough to say that
the summer was one of incessant movement to
Gavin Hamilton and St. Arnaud. Both of them
were, however, of so much natural activity, that
nothing could have suited them better than the
constant marching, manœuvring, and fighting of
the summer of 1758. It was a particularly cool
and healthful summer, and in spite of hard work
and soldier’s fare, both of them grew more robust
than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>For Gavin, it was a time as nearly free from
care and sorrow as often comes on this planet. He
had got his promotion, and blossomed forth as a
full lieutenant. He ardently loved the soldier’s
life; he appreciated greatly his extreme good fortune,
and although he had but little money, he
required but little while the campaign lasted. It
is true he was beginning to acquire tastes very
much above the rigid poverty in which he had been
reared, and sometimes thought rather ruefully of
the slenderness of his pay if he should be in Vienna
the next winter, which he ardently hoped he
would. But with the joyous carelessness of youth,
he considered it settled that as soon as he was
twenty-one, which would be in December, he would
demand his mother’s recognition by his father, and
force Sir Gavin to make Lady Hamilton a handsome
allowance. Gavin did not trouble himself
very much with the details and difficulties of this
brilliant scheme, but only figured out how he would
manage to live when it would be no longer necessary
for him to divide his scanty pay with his
mother. He sometimes talked about it to St. Arnaud,
but St. Arnaud could enlighten him very
little as to his rights under the English laws.
However, it is very easy at twenty, with health and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>strength and an officer’s commission and a good
horse, to throw future perplexities to the winds.
This was what Gavin Hamilton did. He was
made happy by frequent letters from his mother,
who always wrote cheerfully, and to whom, Gavin
knew, her present time of rest and peace and hope
was blessed. To live upon a little money, and to
spend a part of every day in teaching Freda and
Gretchen, was no hardship to one who had known
Lady Hamilton’s sad vicissitudes. Unlike Gavin,
she did not look for any redress from Sir Gavin
Hamilton for a long time to come. Not until
Gavin himself had reached maturity and considerable
rank did she think he would he able to enter
into a contest for his rights; but it was enough for
her to know that she was at last recognized as Sir
Gavin Hamilton’s lawful wife, and that Gavin
was tacitly allowed the position that was his by
every right.</p>

<p>In August the battle of Zorndorf had been
fought, in which Frederick had very handsomely
beaten the Russians under General Fermor, and
Marshal Daun, with his usual caution, had fallen
back behind Dresden to Stolpen, where he took up,
as always, a strong position. There, for four
weeks, he faced Frederick, and withstood much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>provocation to do battle, knowing that every day
Frederick’s supplies were getting shorter, and the
longer the battle was delayed the worse the case
of the King of Prussia.</p>

<p>Loudon’s corps had the extreme outpost, and
barred the road to Bautzen, where the Prussians
had their magazines of food and ammunition.
During all the month of September there was continual
manœuvring and fighting for this road to
Bautzen. But General Loudon managed to dispose
of all whom Frederick sent against him, until
one October day, Frederick himself, with his whole
force, took up his march for Bautzen. Then there
was great commotion in the whole Austrian army,
and in Loudon’s corps especially. There was much
riding to and fro in the mountain roads and passes,
quick mustering of the grenadiers, but it was
known tolerably early that the movement was one
in force, and that General Loudon could by no
means stop it, and could only harass and delay it,
which was done with a will. But by sunset the
attempt was given over, and it was seen that the
next move in the game must be by Marshal Daun
with his whole army.</p>

<p>Toward night, as Gavin and St. Arnaud were
making ready to bivouac with their men, General
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>Loudon and his staff rode by. The general stopped
and beckoned to Gavin.</p>

<p>“Your horse appears to be fresh,” said he, “and
I wish to send a last dispatch to Marshal Daun to-night.
Take a small escort, and carry this to Stolpen
as quickly as possible. You should be able to
bring me a reply before daylight to-morrow morning.
Marshal Daun will provide you with fresh
horses;” and tearing a leaf out of his pocket-book,
and using his hat for a writing-desk, he scribbled
a few lines in pencil, addressed them to Marshal
Daun, and rode on.</p>

<p>It did not take Gavin five minutes to mount and
be off, with a couple of troopers trotting behind
him. The night was falling, and it grew dark in
the mountain fastnesses; but so much had Gavin
and his men ridden over those tortuous and rocky
roads in the last few weeks, that not only they,
but their horses, knew the way perfectly. They
rode on steadily, occasionally meeting with returning
couriers; but by nine o’clock they seemed to
be the only travellers on the road. They were passing
through a dense woodland, hemmed in on each
side of the road by rocky walls, when suddenly a
small party of men appeared in their path, swiftly
and silently, as shadows rising from the earth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>Gavin had no apprehension of an enemy, and supposed
he was meeting a belated party of Austrians.
This was confirmed when the person, apparently
an officer, at the head of the number, rode up to
Gavin, and said:</p>

<p>“I presume that you are an officer, and going
toward Stolpen.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” answered Gavin, trying to
make out in the half darkness the uniform of the
person addressing him.</p>

<p>“Then, may I ask you to deliver a letter to
Marshal Daun? I am not at liberty to say from
whom it is, but it will be a favour to Marshal Daun
if you can contrive it into his hands.”</p>

<p>Gavin hesitated for a moment as the stranger
drew a letter from his breast; and then, to
Gavin’s infinite surprise, threw the letter on the
ground, and the whole party galloped off. One
of Gavin’s troopers, dismounting, picked the letter
up, and striking his flint, the address was easily
read. It was to his Excellency, Field-Marshal
Daun.</p>

<p>Then followed a correct enumeration of Marshal
Daun’s titles and honours. And at the very first
glance Gavin recognized the handwriting of Frederick
of Prussia. To make sure, he took from his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>breast pocket the treasured memorandum, which he
always carried, that Frederick had given him the
night of their adventure at Breslau. Yes, it was
impossible to mistake that handwriting, and there
was not the smallest attempt to disguise it on the
mysterious letter. Gavin returned both to his
safest pocket, and rode on steadily.</p>

<p>At one o’clock in the morning he and his two
troopers clattered into the camp at Stolpen. He
was at once shown to Marshal Daun’s headquarters,
a peasant’s hut, in which a light was burning
and a couple of hard-worked aides-de-camp were
busy at a writing-table.</p>

<p>“The marshal has just gone into the inner room,
but left orders that he should be aroused at once,
should any dispatches come from General Loudon,”
said one of them.</p>

<p>The marshal, however, saved them the trouble,
for, hearing voices in the outer room, he appeared
at the rude door that separated the rooms. He had
lain down wrapped in his cloak, and it still hung
about him.</p>

<p>Politely motioning Gavin to sit, he opened and
read General Loudon’s dispatch, and promptly dictated
a reply to his aide. When that was done,
Gavin handed him the mysterious letter he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>had received, briefly recounting the circumstances
under which he received it.</p>

<p>Marshal Daun read it attentively, and then, laying
it down on the table, said with a puzzled air:</p>

<p>“This is very strange. This letter appears to
be a reply to a letter I wrote General Fermor before
the battle of Zorndorf, warning him against
rashly engaging the King of Prussia, and expressing
my high opinion of the King as a military
man. I have had no word of reply to it until now,
and this letter is not in General Fermor’s handwriting.
I will read it to you.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Your Excellency was in the right to warn me
against a cunning enemy whom you knew better
than I. Here have I tried fighting him and got
beaten. Your unfortunate&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class="smcap">Fermor</span>.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Gavin, taking Frederick’s letter from his pocket,
silently laid it before the marshal, and Marshal
Daun, after reading it, passed it over to his aides.
A universal grin went around, not even excepting
the grave and ceremonious field-marshal, at poor
General Fermor’s expense.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Marshal Daun, after a moment,
“the King of Prussia is entitled to his pleasantry.
And I am sincerely glad he knows that I am incapable
of one of the greatest faults of a soldier&mdash;underrating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span> the enemy.
I ever considered that
king, since first I had the honour of fighting him,
as one of the great masters of the art of war, and
I have no objection to his knowing it. General
Fermor did not know it, and behold, he was beaten
at Zorndorf.”</p>

<p>There was no time to be lost in returning, and
fresh horses being already provided, within half
an hour Gavin was on his way back to General
Loudon. As he rode along in the darkness, and
then in the gray dawn, he could not help laughing
at Frederick’s grim humour. Clearly, he had taken
some trouble to get his reply conveyed to Marshal
Daun, and Gavin had no doubt that the troopers
who had delivered it to him were really Prussians,
disguised. By daylight he had got to General Loudon’s
headquarters, and after delivering his dispatches
went to the hut of boughs in which St.
Arnaud and himself spread their blankets. He
was very tired, but before lying down to sleep he
told St. Arnaud about the King of Prussia’s letter.</p>

<p>“How like the elfish nature of the man!” was
St. Arnaud’s comment.</p>

<p>The utmost activity prevailed in the Austrian
ranks after Frederick’s escape, and it became
known through that telepathy which anticipates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>great events that a general engagement was impending;
and when on the night of the 5th of
October, in the midst of a drenching rain, wild
wind, and pitch darkness, the whole Austrian army
abandoned Stolpen, and took up its march for Kittlitz,
a strong position east of Bautzen and of Hochkirch,
around which was collected the whole of the
King of Prussia’s army, all knew that the hour
was at hand.</p>

<p>So secretly was this done, that, although it was
known that the Austrian army was on the move,
it was with the greatest surprise that, on the evening
of the 10th of October, Frederick, reaching
Hochkirch, found Marshal Daun securely established
with ninety thousand men in lines many
miles long on the woody heights that surround the
hill upon which the village of Hochkirch&mdash;of immortal
memory&mdash;stands. Frederick had but his
forty thousand, and the amazement of the Austrians
was as great as their delight when they saw
this mighty captain, usually so wise in the disposition
of his armies, walk into a ring encircled by
his enemies, and then quietly sit down before them.</p>

<p>A part of Loudon’s corps was encamped on a
wooded crest, the Czarnabog, or Devil’s Mountain,
as the village people called it, and among them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>was the regiment of St. Arnaud and Gavin. It
was a lovely, still, autumn afternoon when the two,
standing together at the highest point of the mountain,
saw the mass of Prussians coming into sight
on the opposing heights, divided only by the Lobau
water, and the many streams and brooks that
go to make up the Spree. As it became plain that
the dark masses of approaching men were Prussians,
St. Arnaud and Gavin, standing in a group
of other officers, could not conceal their surprise.</p>

<p>“This king must be mad,” said St. Arnaud.
Gavin nodded, and continued to watch the Prussians,
as a post for several thousand of them was
being marked out not half a mile distant from the
heights, dense with trees, where thousands of Austrians,
with several batteries of heavy guns, were
placed.</p>

<p>Numbers of Prussian officers were seen moving
about as the various regiments marched in, and
at last a group on horseback appeared, in which
was a figure that St. Arnaud and Gavin instantly
recognized without glasses. Worn, thin, and wizened
as he was, Frederick of Prussia was ever an
imposing figure. All who saw that slight, pale
man, shabbily dressed, but splendidly mounted,
riding nonchalantly into the view of tens of thousands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
of men, were thrilled at the sight of him.
Here was one of the world’s masters and dictators.
Beaten he might be, he was never conquered; less
in force than his enemy, he was always dangerous;
with but a thousand men behind him, he could
yet keep his enemies awake at night. He rode to
the edge of the plateau on which the village is built,
and surveyed the long lines of his enemies drawn
up for many miles in the woods, and hills, and hollows
close by. The sun was sinking in a blaze of
glory, and its mellow light fell upon a landscape
singularly beautiful. In a long, deep valley ran a
rapid and musical stream, with many branches.
White villages nestled among the hills, and the
blue air was pierced by slender church steeples.
A thin haze, from many thousands of camp-fires,
enveloped the valleys in mysterious beauty, and
the white tents, in tens of thousands, lay like snowflakes
on the still green earth. No eye noted this,
though, as long as Frederick of Prussia remained
in sight, his slight, compact figure on his horse
silhouetted against the evening sky. Suddenly
from the wooded heights, directly in front of him,
a flash and a roar burst forth, and twenty Austrian
cannon-balls ploughed up the ground. The
King’s horse stood motionless&mdash;the charger that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>carried Frederick the Great must needs be used
to cannon and musketry fire&mdash;and Frederick himself,
without changing his position, put his field-glass
to his eyes, and coolly surveyed the scene.
A dozen officers galloped toward him, but Frederick
with a gesture motioned them away. Five minutes
of perfect silence followed. Of the thousands
who beheld him, every man held his breath; and
when a second round roared out, a kind of universal
groan and shudder ran like electricity through
the watching multitudes. This time it threw some
earth upon the King, and then, calmly dusting it
off, he turned and rode toward the village church.
Ten minutes after, Gavin and St. Arnaud eagerly
watching, he appeared upon the little belfry. Twilight
was falling, though, and it was no longer possible
to see clearly. Lights were twinkling, and
the blaze of the camp-fires became lurid in the falling
darkness. In a little while silence but for the
sentry’s tread, and darkness but for the camp-fires
burning through the chill autumn night, had settled
down upon the scene.</p>

<p>The next morning rose clear and beautiful, and
daylight only showed more plainly the extreme
danger of Frederick’s position. It was known,
however, through spies, that it would be impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
for him to leave for several days, owing to a
lack of provisions and ammunition upon any road
that he might take. The Austrians wished to lull
him into security, and three days were spent in
what seemed to the Prussians preparations to defend
themselves on the part of the Austrians. The
air resounded with thousands of axes hewing trees,
to form abatis; slight earthworks were thrown up,
and Marshal Daun gave every sign of preparing to
defend himself rather than to attack. He even
continued to have false information sent Frederick,
that the Austrians were preparing to fall back on
Zittau. But at nightfall, on Friday, the 13th of
October, thirty thousand Austrians stole away,
leaving their camp-fires brightly burning, and enclosing
Frederick on the only side he had been
free, rendered his escape impossible, except by
cutting his way through.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud’s and Gavin’s regiment were kept
concealed in the Devil’s Mountains. Wild beyond
expression were these hills, with vast boulders,
black hollows, trees standing so close that daylight
scarcely penetrated, and tangled thickets. In these
dark hills three thousand men were easily hidden.
Through these thick wildernesses were cut roads
for the ammunition wagons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>The night of the 13th of October was moonless
and starless. The fair days preceding had been
followed by a day of dun clouds and brown fog.
During the dark and rainy night, when the silent
movement of thirty thousand Austrians, under
Marshal Daun himself, had taken place, the three
thousand grenadiers and light troops of Loudon’s
corps, encamped in the Devil’s Mountains, had
peacefully spent the night. At four o’clock they
were to be called by their officers, without blare of
the trumpet; and when the clock in the belfry of
the village church of Hochkirch struck five they
were to fall upon the Prussians. Gavin and St.
Arnaud, having to be awake early, did not sit up
late, but wrapped in their cloaks, with their saddles
for pillows, lay down before a roaring fire,
which was to be kept up all night, and were soon
asleep.</p>

<p>At three o’clock St. Arnaud rose. It was pitch
dark but for the ruddy blaze of the fire still burning,
and a cold, brown mist hid everything from
sight except the ring of light from the fire. Gavin
was still sleeping&mdash;he always slept until he was
roused.</p>

<p>The orderly was already preparing something
savoury in an iron pan, and when it was ready St.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>Arnaud gave Gavin a vigorous shake, which
brought him to his feet at once. Without losing
a moment he fell to upon the contents of the pan;
for there was no hour of the day or night that
Gavin Hamilton was not ready to eat and to fight.</p>

<p>“Bad for the Prussians, this fog,” he said between
mouthfuls of bacon and cheese.</p>

<p>“Very,” laconically replied St. Arnaud, who
was not half the trencher-man that Gavin was.</p>

<p>Their horses were already fed and saddled, and
in a few minutes they were on horseback, going
through the ranks of soldiers, who were munching
their breakfasts while the horses munched their
hay.</p>

<p>At half-past four o’clock, when it was still perfectly
dark, the Austrians were ready and ranked
and waiting for the church clock to toll five. It
seemed a long wait, and St. Arnaud noticed Gavin
blinking his eyes with sleep as he sat on his horse.
Presently, through the white mist which wrapped
the world for them, echoed five delicate, light
strokes of the clock on the village hill, and immediately
after the silvery sound of the Prussian
bugles sounded faintly through the fog.</p>

<p>And then came a sudden deafening roar of artillery,
a crashing of musketry from many thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
muskets, and in an instant of time the Prussians
were surrounded by a ring of fire five miles
in circumference.</p>

<p>By that time St. Arnaud’s and Gavin’s regiment
was picking its way out of the woods, toward
the village of Winschke, where it was to support
the grenadiers. As they came into the open
country the impenetrable mist lay over the whole
earth; but it was lighted up at every moment, and
in a vast circle, by the blaze of gunpowder. Across
the valley, by the constant flashes they could see
great masses of Austrian cavalry dashing themselves
upon the Prussian infantry, which was completely
surprised. The Prussians in the village
were awake, too, and the Austrians were pouring
in upon them. The thunder of the artillery, the
sharp crash of musketry, the shouts and cries,
rang through the hills and valleys, where a hundred
and thirty thousand men were fighting.</p>

<p>It was trying work, standing still at the brow
of the hill, waiting for the word to charge down the
hill, ford the little river, and up the steep incline
to the village. All around them was fighting&mdash;masses
of Austrians, horse and foot, throwing
themselves upon the Prussians, who were outnumbered
two to one, but making a stiff defence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
and commanded by the greatest captain of
the age.</p>

<p>“I wonder what kind of a humour the King was
in this morning when he was waked by our pounding
him?” asked Gavin of St. Arnaud.</p>

<p>“He was not waked, that you may depend upon.
He was no doubt up and on horseback by five
o’clock. But his headquarters are two miles away,
and it must have taken him some little time to
form a plan of defence, for he could not tell at
first that he was being attacked on all sides at
once.”</p>

<p>“It is said that when Marwitz, his adjutant,
was called upon to mark off the post Tuesday evening,
he flatly refused to do it, saying he would
have no part in marking off a post so dangerous,
and the King promptly ordered him under arrest.”</p>

<p>“He was to get away from here this afternoon,
only Marshal Daun was, for once, beforehand with
him&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;ah!” for at this a Prussian battery
wheeled in front of them and opened up with
vigour.</p>

<p>“Forward!” rang out, and the regiment moved
as if on parade, the trot down hill increasing to a
gallop up the hill, after they had crossed the
stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>From that on Gavin saw nothing of the battle
except the furious mêlée just around him. The
Prussians held the village stubbornly, and with a
battery of artillery and a few regiments of infantry
stood like rocks, while the Austrians poured infantry
and cavalry upon them. Gavin, at the head
of his troop, dashed again and again at the Prussian
lines, only to be repulsed. He heard himself
as in a dream shouting:</p>

<p>“Come on! Their ammunition can’t last forever!”</p>

<p>And as the Austrians came on, an endless, steady
stream, never ceasing, he saw riding out of the
mist, which was slowly melting before the rising
sun, the figure of the King of Prussia. He dashed
among the struggling Prussian infantry, and as if
by magic a line of bayonets was formed around
him, against which the Austrians threw themselves
like an avalanche of fire and steel. Then came a
Titanic struggle, men, guns, and horses inextricably
mixed, no man having time to load and fire,
but steel to steel, sabres and bayonets, and a fearful
and hideous din drowning the roar of cannon
and shriek of musketry. No man asked or gave
quarter, but with powder-blackened faces and grim
eyes and distorted features sought death or gave it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>
<p>It lasted a short ten minutes, but it seemed
hours. Gavin Hamilton, in the midst of it, whirling
his sabre like a flail, found himself, he knew
not how, on the ground, with his riderless horse
plunging wildly near him, a forest of Austrian
bayonets behind him, and a steady line of Prussian
steel in front of him. Sometimes that line
wavered, sometimes it broke, but it always formed
again. And suddenly the line of glittering steel
parted for a moment, and he saw the King of Prussia
for one moment erect on his horse, and the next
the horse staggered and fell, and Gavin, running
forward, with his strong left arm seized Frederick
by the arm, shrieking:</p>

<p>“You took me prisoner once; now it is my
turn!”</p>

<p>Their eyes met for one brief instant, and the
glance that Frederick gave him made Gavin forget
the battle, the uproar, the danger&mdash;all, except
those steel-blue eyes, sparkling with the light of
battle; that slight, wiry figure, with one uplifted
arm, and the singular music of that voice, ringing
out above the shouting and the clash of arms:</p>

<p>“Not yet! Not yet!”</p>

<p>The ancient Germans represented their god of
war as huge, blonde, and bearded; Gavin Hamilton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
would have said that Frederick of Prussia,
unhorsed, defeated, and almost captured, was the
ideal of the lord of battles.</p>

<p>In another moment a regiment of Prussian hussars
appeared as if they had sprung out of the
ground, their horses plunging over every obstacle,
their sabres flashing right and left; and encircling
the King, he was swept out of sight like magic. It
was over in the twinkling of an eye&mdash;one instant
Gavin had Frederick by the arm, looking into his
blue and blazing eyes; the next instant there was
a trampling of iron hoofs, a flashing of steel, a
torrent of men, and Gavin had dropped to his
knees without so much as feeling a blow. Only
everything grew suddenly indistinct and far away,
and then he knew no more.</p>

<p>It seemed to him but another instant before he
revived, perfectly alive to everything, but it was
strangely quiet after the fierce confusion of the
last charge. There was still fighting going on, but
it was far at the other end of the village, and elsewhere
it seemed to be quite over. He opened his
eyes, and glanced upward; the mist was rolling
off the valleys, and the sun, shining in unclouded
splendour, was high in the heavens. It must be at
least nine o’clock, thought Gavin, and he knew it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>was not more than six when the order to charge
was given. He concluded that he had been knocked
on the head by a Prussian musket or a horse’s
hoof. Glancing around again, he saw himself in
a pool of blood. A dozen men lay in ghastly attitudes
near him, and within touch of his hand
was a dead horse. Gavin recognized the horse&mdash;it
was the one ridden by the King of Prussia.</p>

<p>He grew faint presently, and concluded it was
the neighbourhood of the horse; he tried to get up
and walk away, which he failed to accomplish, and
knew no more. When he next came to himself, he
was lying in a little cart jolting along the road, and
his head was aching miserably. He was in the
open country, and the stars were shining overhead.
It was very cold, and St. Arnaud was holding his
head and trying to wrap him the better in cloaks.
Gavin made quite sure before he spoke; then he
said:</p>

<p>“St. Arnaud, is the King of Prussia a prisoner?”</p>

<p>“No. As well try to take the devil prisoner
as that man.”</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>“But for the wound in my head I could have
done it. I had my hand on him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<p>“It would take ten thousand men like you to
carry off that Frederick of Prussia. The Prussian
hussars did for you and the rest of our poor fellows
very handsomely.”</p>

<p>“Yes; this wound in my head”&mdash;</p>

<p>“You have no wound in your head.”</p>

<p>“But I have, I tell you. It makes me suffer
terribly.”</p>

<p>“The wound is in your leg. It is broken, but
the surgeons have set it, and I am taking you to
Zittau. There you can be treated, and I shall
return to the regiment.”</p>

<p>“Yes; it is in my leg; I know it now. Did I
lose my sword?”</p>

<p>“No; you were holding it tightly when I found
you.”</p>

<p>“So you came to look after me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Everything was over, and what
was left of the Prussians in full retreat before ten
o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Are the Prussians really beaten?”</p>

<p>“As much as they ever are. Frederick will be
up and at us again in a month as if he had never
been beaten at all. But he has lost Marshal Keith.
The marshal’s body was found among a heap
of slain, watched by a foot-soldier, an Englishman,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>who had it carried into the church. And there General
Lacy recognized the grand old marshal. General
Lacy wept at the sight. The marshal will be
buried to-morrow with full military honours, as if
he were an Austrian marshal, General Lacy acting
as chief mourner. Frederick has no more Keiths
among his generals.”</p>

<p>Gavin broke out into a cry, so terrible was the
jolting of the wagon upon his wounded leg.</p>

<p>Presently, when he became calmer, he asked:</p>

<p>“Will my leg be crooked or disfigured in any
way if I get well?”</p>

<p>“Pooh! I don’t know. It is no matter, so you
get well.”</p>

<p>“But my legs are very important to me, at
least.”</p>

<p>“You are very vain of them. Well, I dare say
they will be all right.”</p>

<p>Hours of agony followed, and Gavin was not
of the sort to endure pain silently. He moaned
and cried incessantly, and St. Arnaud comforted
him as a mother comforts a suffering child.</p>

<p>By daylight he was at Zittau, lying in a rude
bed in an artisan’s house. St. Arnaud stayed with
him a few hours, and then was obliged to leave
him, but not before sending an express to Vienna
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>to Lady Hamilton, to Gavin’s joy and relief. He
felt, as he lay in agonizing pain upon his hard bed,
that could he but know his mother was near, half
his suffering would be over.</p>

<p>Six days of suffering followed, suffering that
turned his ruddy cheeks to a deathly pallor, and
brought lines never to be effaced in his boyish face.
He burned with fever, while racked with anguish,
and neither day nor night brought him any relief.
The artisan’s family were kind to him, and he had
the surgical attention necessary, but Zittau was
full of wounded Austrians, and all suffered hardships.</p>

<p>On the sixth evening, just as Gavin felt himself
sinking into delirium, the door to his little room
opened. He thought it was the woman of the
house coming to do what little she could for him;
but oh, happiness! it was his mother; and behind
her was thirteen-year-old Freda, lugging a great
soft pillow; and Gavin, throwing his arms around
his mother’s neck as she clasped him, sobbed and
cried with joy and pain as he had not done since
he was a little lad.</p>

<p>His mother, to soothe him, told him the circumstances
of her coming to him.</p>

<p>“As soon as I had that dear St. Arnaud’s letter,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>Madame Ziska and Count Kalenga got the money
for my journey, and they insisted I should not
start alone, and would have me take Freda, who is
worth ten grown women for helpfulness. The Empress
Queen herself sent me a message, saying you
were at Zittau; and Prince Kaunitz gave me a letter
enabling me to get post-horses anywhere on the
road. So here we are, to stay until you can be
moved to Vienna.”</p>

<p>The pain was no better for many days, but it
was incomparably easier for Gavin to bear, with
his mother’s tender ministrations and Freda’s untiring
help, who was ever at hand to do, with the
greatest intelligence, whatever was to be done.
With all of Gavin’s youth and strength, it was yet
six weeks before he could be moved to Vienna by
easy stages. It was not an unhappy six weeks.
The Austrians were in high spirits, and that was
of great advantage in the convalescence of all the
wounded. Gavin received early assurances of promotion
and a good command as soon as the spring
campaign opened. He, however, was not a conspicuously
good patient, but rather the other way.
He not only required to be nursed, but to be entertained,
and in this last particular his mother’s
natural gifts and accomplishments were invaluable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>In return for all that she could do, however, Gavin
would occasionally long for St. Arnaud’s charming
society, and was far from polite in expressing
his wishes. When he grew intolerable his mother
would quietly withdraw, and let him get over his
fit of ill humour as best he could. Little Freda, on
the contrary, would be more tender and attentive
the less he deserved it, and rewarded, rather than
punished, his spells of diabolism.</p>

<p>When Gavin was able to sit up, he found diversion
in keeping up the English lessons with Freda
that Lady Hamilton had begun. The first sign of
his return to his old self was one day when she
discovered that he was teaching the innocent Freda
the most outlandish pronunciation of English
words, and laughing uproariously at her.</p>

<p>“I should think a young gentleman who calls
his own name Ameeltone would try to mend his
own pronunciation instead of imposing on Freda,
who can say Hamilton quite well,” was Lady Hamilton’s
comment.</p>

<p>In December, after a slow journey, Gavin found
himself in his old quarters again, to the delight of
his mother and his good friends. He was not yet
able to attend the Empress Queen’s levee, but an
aide-de-camp of the Emperor’s had come to make
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>formal inquiry concerning him and to bring a kind
message from the sovereigns.</p>

<p>In December was Gavin’s twenty-first birthday,
and to his great delight he found that St. Arnaud,
then in winter quarters at Olmutz, would come to
Vienna for a short visit about that time. On the
winter afternoon that St. Arnaud arrived Gavin
threw aside his crutches. It was his twenty-first
birthday.</p>

<p>Madame Ziska had arranged a little feast for
them, and Lady Hamilton, who had taken the utmost
interest in it, had gone out with Freda to
attend to some of the preparations. St. Arnaud
arrived at five o’clock, and a few minutes after
Freda returned alone, with a letter. She ran upstairs,
and with a pale, scared face handed it to
Gavin. It ran thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have this moment heard that your father is
ill with smallpox and deserted by all his servants.
I am going to him. I forbid you to come to the
house, from the danger of infection not only to
yourself, but to the family of our friends. You
may, however, come to-morrow morning and every
morning at nine o’clock to the corner of the street,
and if all goes well I will be at the middle window
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>in the second story with a white handkerchief in
my hand. If I should never see you again, be
always a good man, and do not cease to love your
devoted mother.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class="smcap">M. Hamilton.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>Gavin, weakened by his illness, fell back in his
chair, faint and overcome. St. Arnaud had to do
the questioning of little Freda, who, though much
frightened, could yet give a very intelligent account
of what had happened.</p>

<p>“We were coming out of a shop,” she said,
“when a man, looking like a servant, came up to
us, and catching Lady Hamilton by the sleeve,
begged her to go to a house not far off, where he
said Sir Gavin Hamilton lay dying of smallpox,
and quite alone. Lady Hamilton trembled very
much at that, and asked him why he had deserted
his master. The man answered that he had a wife
and children, and when all the other servants left
he was afraid to stay; and then it came out&mdash;for
the man did not at first tell it&mdash;that he had left
Sir Gavin the day before, and had gone for a doctor,
but did not know whether the doctor went to
Sir Gavin or not. But the man felt troubled
about his master, and knowing about Lady Hamilton,
had followed her up, and watched for her to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>come out of the shop. Then Lady Hamilton, weeping
very much, went back into the shop, and wrote
this letter, and brought me to the corner of our
street, and kissing me good-by, went off with the
man.”</p>

<p>Gavin started up, crying out:</p>

<p>“I must go at once to my mother!” but sank
back, exhausted; and St. Arnaud, seeing the necessity
for quieting him, said:</p>

<p>“I will go to the house, which I know well, and
try to attract Lady Hamilton’s attention, and perhaps
I can find out something.”</p>

<p>He went immediately, and returned in half an
hour. He found Gavin much agitated, and Madame
Ziska and Freda vainly trying to calm him.
The news St. Arnaud brought was not, however,
calculated to soothe poor Gavin.</p>

<p>“I went straight to the house&mdash;one of the finest
in the court quarter,” he said. “It was not necessary
to know that the house had been hastily abandoned.
Doors and even windows were wide open,
and Sir Gavin’s dog, a huge mastiff, lay moaning
with hunger on the stairs of the main entrance, for
the servants fled yesterday. There was but a solitary
light in the whole vast place&mdash;I suppose, in
Sir Gavin’s room, I stood on the street below, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>threw pebbles at a window, until Lady Hamilton
appeared at the window of a lower room. ‘He is
very ill,’ she said, ‘and I believe would not have
lived through another night had I not come. He
is now delirious.’ I asked her if Sir Gavin’s valet
had sent her a doctor. She replied the doctor had
not yet come. At that moment the doctor arrived,
on foot. I noticed that his man, following
with his medicine case, was deeply pitted with
smallpox, and I asked the doctor if, for a handsome
consideration, I could engage this man to assist
Lady Hamilton, which he agreed to, after making
sure that Sir Gavin was of the rank and
position to pay well for all that was done for him.
So that she is now provided with help. I remained
outside until Lady Hamilton again appeared at
the window. She was weeping, and told me the
doctor thought Sir Gavin could hardly survive
many hours.”</p>

<p>“Why should my mother weep for that man,
who has made her whole life wretched; and why&mdash;ah,
why should she risk her life for him?” cried
Gavin, throwing himself about in his chair in his
agony of grief and alarm.</p>

<p>“Because,” quietly replied St. Arnaud, “she
loves him still. I have seen it always. Your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>mother, Gavin, is one of those faithful women,
whose love once given cannot be withdrawn; who
silently and patiently endure to the end, and whose
unshaken constancy makes one admire and despair.
In one moment of Sir Gavin’s danger she forgot
twenty-one years of insults and injuries.”</p>

<p>“I cannot understand it,” sighed Gavin.</p>

<p>“Nor can I. Only exalted souls like hers can.
But I tell you a fact, which I have seen in Lady
Hamilton’s eyes ever since the first moment I saw
her, that Sir Gavin Hamilton has never ceased to
be dear to her, although her pride forbade her to
acknowledge it. There could be no doubt of it to-night
when, sobbing and trembling, she told me
that in his delirium he raved of her and his child
as they were twenty years ago, and moaned that
his wife would not come to him. She sent you her
dearest love and prayers, and only begged, if you
valued her happiness, to keep away from the infection.
She will talk to you from the window, as
she did to me; it is some distance from the
ground.”</p>

<p>The birthnight supper was a very different affair
from what had been planned. Although all
tried to cheer Gavin, and make him hopeful of the
best, all of them were oppressed with fear. Lady
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>Hamilton’s life was in jeopardy every hour. Gavin
slept not at all that night, and soon after sunrise
was standing with a forlorn face under his
mother’s window. He looked listlessly at the
splendid façade, the marble steps, the tall, bronze
lamps, all the evidences of wealth, and wondered
stupidly at the good and evil in human nature,
which made all desert Sir Gavin in his hour of
direst need except the one human being he had
most injured.</p>

<p>Not until nine o’clock did Lady Hamilton appear
at the window.</p>

<p>“He still lives,” she said.</p>

<p>It was in Gavin’s heart to say that he cared not
whether Sir Gavin lived or died if but she escaped;
but he dared not.</p>

<p>“Mother,” cried Gavin, “I have not slept since
your letter came, and I have been here since sunrise.”</p>

<p>“My poor, poor Gavin! Would you break your
mother’s heart by making yourself ill? Go home
now, and do not come back until to-morrow at
nine.”</p>

<p>“Mother, I shall go mad if I do not see you
again this day. Let me come at sunset. I <i>will</i>
come, and I will stand on this pavement until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
you speak to me, if it is until to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, at sunset, dearest.”</p>

<p>Days of agonizing suspense followed for Gavin.
He learned in that time to know that, fearful as
bodily pain is, it is a bed of roses to mental anguish.
All he had suffered with his wounds was
nothing to what he endured in those December
days when his mother remained in the infected
house. Sir Gavin, after a week of the extremest
danger, began to hold his own, and then to gain
a little and a little. This change was plain in every
tone of Lady Hamilton’s voice, and in every lineament
of her pale, glorified face. It amazed and
confounded Gavin, but it waked no jealousy in his
heart. His nature was too large, too free, too liberal,
to let a shade come between his mother and
himself. He knew that she had once loved his
father well; and when he came to examine his
memory he could not recall a single expression of
resentment she had ever used against Sir Gavin.
True, she had approved Gavin on each of the two
occasions when he had resented his father’s treatment
of her, but Gavin felt that in strict justice
she must have approved him, and it would have
been a fatal mistake for him to have acted otherwise.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
But though convinced of Sir Gavin’s wickedness
of conduct, she could not wholly withdraw
the memory of her love, and at the first need of
her it rose again, full of life and vitality.</p>

<p>It was eight weeks before Sir Gavin was entirely
well and it was safe to enter the house. But on a
bright and spring-like February day Gavin was to
be allowed to see his mother. Lady Hamilton
had especially asked that St. Arnaud and Madame
Ziska come with him. She knew her own power
over Gavin, but she was not quite sure of his resistance,
and knowing well that both of these noble
souls would be on her side, she thought it well to
have them at hand.</p>

<p>Arrived at the house, a striking change was visible
in its aspect from the day that its master lay
ill and deserted to the time when he was again
the Sir Gavin Hamilton of old. A splendidly liveried
porter opened the great carved door, and
within four powdered and silk-stockinged footmen
obsequiously showed them into a noble drawing-room.
But Gavin saw nothing except his mother,
flitting down the grand staircase as the door
opened; and bounding up three steps at the time,
he caught her in his strong, young arms, and covered
her face with kisses. And then, holding her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>off at arm’s length, he studied her countenance,
thinking to find her thin and pallid. But instead,
he had never seen her face so round, so delicately
rosy, so nearly beautiful. Lady Hamilton’s examination
of him was not nearly so satisfactory.</p>

<p>“My poor, poor Gavin!” she said, and tears
sprung to her eyes. Gavin had not endured six
weeks of bodily pain and eight weeks of the anguish
of fear without showing it.</p>

<p>After a few grateful words to Madame Ziska
and St. Arnaud, Lady Hamilton turned and said
with authority to Gavin:</p>

<p>“You will now go with me to your father’s
room.”</p>

<p>Gavin, obeying the habit of years, went with his
mother silently. His mind was in a tumult. He
had hated his father very deeply ever since he could
remember, nor was he capable of the sublime self-forgetfulness
of his mother; for he not only bitterly
resented his mother’s injuries, but his own.
He, the son of a man rich, powerful, and well
born, had spent his youth in poverty, in ignorance
of many things, in the hardship of a private soldier’s
lot. No; he could never forgive his father.
He was saying this to himself when his mother
stopped before a large door, and spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span></p>

<p>“Sir Gavin is changed&mdash;more changed than I
could have believed. And this change was not
brought about for any advantage to be gained;
it is that, looking death in the face, his better
self was heard. He told me almost in the
first days that he was conscious he always yearned
over you as other fathers yearn over their sons,
and at the very time he tried to win you from me
he felt ten times the longing for you when you
showed a spirit loyal to your mother. Sir Gavin,
with all his faults, is not the man to miss the point
of honour, and he respects that in you. He says
often to me, whenever we speak of you, ‘The boy
is no poltroon.’”</p>

<p>“But what, mother,” asked Gavin, firmly, “of
his treatment of you?”</p>

<p>“That is between us, and with it you have nothing
to do,” replied Lady Hamilton, with a flush
rising to her face. “It is enough to know that Sir
Gavin will do all he can to atone&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Atone!” cried Gavin, wheeling around and
bringing his fist down on the wainscoting in a burst
of rage.</p>

<p>The door opened noiselessly, and Sir Gavin
Hamilton, dreadfully changed in appearance, but
with the same indomitable coolness, appeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span></p>

<p>“The boy is right,” he said, turning to Lady
Hamilton. “Men talk of atonement; how imperfect
must it ever be! This boy hates me; it may
be long before he feels otherwise. But for myself,
I do not hate him, and never hated him. I
should have despised him, though, had he accepted
the conditions I offered him.”</p>

<p>“Yet you offered them,” replied Gavin; “you
offered me anything and everything if I would
abandon my mother.”</p>

<p>Sir Gavin waved his hand calmly.</p>

<p>“That is past,” he said. “She saved my life
at the risk of her own. I have offered her the only
recompense possible. I will acknowledge her to be
my wife. Of course, in doing that, I am condemning
my own course for twenty years past.
Well, men sometimes do that. It is not in
me to fall down on my knees and ask the
world to flagellate me. I make neither promises
nor professions. I only offer to regard the imperfect
marriage ceremony which united us as perfectly
valid. We both acted in good faith. The
time came when I would have been glad to have
been free from the bond. I shall make no further
effort. I cannot, in fact, after having received her in
my house, and acknowledged her right to be here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span></p>

<p>It was not gracious, but, as Sir Gavin truly said,
it was not in him to abase himself.</p>

<p>Lady Hamilton’s reply was made with the utmost
dignity.</p>

<p>“I ask nothing but the recognition of my right
and my son’s right. I do not desire to remain in
this house an hour longer than is necessary to establish
the fact in the eyes of the world that I am
Lady Hamilton. Then I shall go with my son
and depend entirely upon him and upon myself.
He has never yet failed me either in respect or affection,
and having secured his right, I have nothing
more to ask.”</p>

<p>Never in all his life had Gavin felt prouder of
his mother than at that moment. Even a gleam
of admiration came into Sir Gavin Hamilton’s
cold eyes. His reply was more conciliatory than
anything he had yet said.</p>

<p>“I do not feel I have the right to exercise any
compulsion over you, madam, but I would suggest
that you remain in my house until I am sufficiently
recovered to attend you to the royal levee. That
will be the simplest as well as the most effective
method of undoing the work of many years.”</p>

<p>Lady Hamilton bowed silently, and Gavin, with
a formal inclination of the head to his father, offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
his mother his arm, and they descended the
stairs.</p>

<p>Sir Gavin, with a strange expression on his face,
watched them as they descended, and when they
reached the first landing, supposing themselves
unseen, mother and son fell into each other’s arms
and clung together. But Sir Gavin Hamilton
stood watching&mdash;watching, while that which did
duty for him as a heart was deeply stirred.</p>

<p>Below were Madame Ziska and St. Arnaud. St.
Arnaud was just saying:</p>

<p>“I am getting frightened, they are so quiet;
Gavin must have thrown his father out of the window,”
when Lady Hamilton and Gavin appeared.</p>

<p>“What did Gavin do?” anxiously cried Madame
Ziska.</p>

<p>“All I could have asked of him,” replied his
mother. She did not say all she could have wished.
She had hoped that he would offer his hand to his
father, but he had not done it. However, glad to
have gained so much from him, Lady Hamilton
would not be too exacting. And Madame Ziska,
by way of encouraging Gavin, said what she did
not feel:</p>

<p>“What a sweet, forgiving Gavin is it!” and
patted his shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>Lady Hamilton then said simply that she would
remain until after the next levee, which she would
attend with Sir Gavin.</p>

<p>“And then you will come back to us,” cried
Gavin.</p>

<p>“If you do not come here,” said St. Arnaud,
out of Gavin’s hearing, and exchanging glances
with Madame Ziska.</p>

<p>Lady Hamilton led them through the splendid
lower floor, the bewigged and bepowdered footmen
obsequiously showing the way, and at the same
time indicating they knew who was mistress there.
On parting, Gavin promised faithfully to return
the next day.</p>

<p>Gavin expected to be met with many urgings
from St. Arnaud and Madame Ziska and Count
Kalenga to be more conciliatory to his father, but
they wisely said nothing. Every day Gavin went
to see his mother, and every day, when he saw her
the acknowledged mistress of his father’s house,
it seemed as if his hatred to Sir Gavin was abating
little by little. On the third day he met Sir
Gavin as he was about to go out in his coach, and
heard him say:</p>

<p>“Make my compliments to Lady Hamilton, and
ask for the honour of her company to drive.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p>The footman disappeared and returned.</p>

<p>“Lady Hamilton sends her compliments, and
regrets she cannot accept Sir Gavin’s invitation.
She is expecting Lieutenant Hamilton.”</p>

<p>Sir Gavin looked so cross and surprised that
Gavin could not restrain a grin&mdash;he had never been
able to smile at anything his father did before.</p>

<p>All this had not been unknown in Vienna society,
and curiosity was at the highest pitch the
night of the royal levee, when the strangely reconciled
couple were to appear for the first time in
public. Gavin and St. Arnaud were to be present&mdash;their
first appearance after the campaign in
which both had distinguished themselves. On the
next day both were to return to their command at
Olmutz. As they rolled along in a hired coach
toward the royal palace St Arnaud said:</p>

<p>“How happy you should be! How I envy
you!”</p>

<p>Gavin was surprised at this. St Arnaud was
always cheerful, even gay, self-contained, and Gavin
had thought a very happy man.</p>

<p>“Why should I not envy you? Compare your
youth with mine.”</p>

<p>“True. But I have no one in the world to love
or to love me. I have neither father nor mother
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>nor brother nor sister. One day I will tell you
some things that may make you pity me.”</p>

<p>Gavin was again surprised, but more wounded
than surprised. He loved St. Arnaud with the devoted
affection of his nature, full of enthusiasm,
and without having lost a single illusion; and to
have St. Arnaud speak of himself as unloved and
unloving cut him to the heart. He said nothing,
and St. Arnaud’s next words reassured him.</p>

<p>“That meeting in the snow was as fortunate
for me as it was for you; it gave me interests,
affections; for what I said just now meant that
I was cut off from those natural ties that give life
most of its charm. I have many comrades&mdash;what
are called friends&mdash;but, except yourself, there is
not one who feels very near to me. I do not know
why it is so. I was ever ready to make friends, but
I only know that you are the one person who knows
my inmost thoughts, the one person to whom I
can ever tell the story of my life.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, tell it to me whenever you like,”
cried Gavin joyously. “And all I can say is, if
you have an enemy, let him beware of me!”</p>

<p>The levee was exceptionally brilliant, and the
event of the evening was undoubtedly the appearance
together of Sir Gavin and Lady Hamilton.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
Gavin, in a fever of excitement, pride, joy,
triumph, and nervousness, waited to see them enter
the grand saloon where the Empress Queen and
Emperor received. Presently they were seen advancing&mdash;Lady
Hamilton radiant in the beauty of
her youth, which seemed to have returned to her,
and Sir Gavin as cool and unconcerned as if a reconciliation
with his wife were no more than rejoining
her after a journey. Prince Kaunitz remarked
confidentially to his intimate, the French
ambassador:</p>

<p>“What a loss, monsieur, to diplomacy is Sir
Gavin Hamilton! Observe his composure, and see
how he outwits all of his enemies by doing the
unexpected thing in the unexpected manner. I
understand he made no move to keep Lady Hamilton
with him permanently until she informed him
she should leave his house immediately he performed
this act of restitution; but as soon as he
found that out, he has been using all his endeavours
to make her stay. If she remains with him, she
can make her position entirely secure and agreeable
by occasionally offering to leave him. The rule of
Sir Gavin Hamilton’s life is the rule of contrary.”</p>

<p>By St. Arnaud’s artful manœuvring, Gavin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>found himself directly behind his father and
mother when they made their obeisance to royalty.
The Empress Queen, who knew the circumstances
perfectly well, was peculiarly gracious to Lady
Hamilton, as was the Emperor.</p>

<p>“Permit me to congratulate you upon your son,
Lieutenant Hamilton,” she said, with her charming
smile and an air of imperial grace. “General
Loudon has spoken of him to the Emperor and
myself with great praise. It is to such young officers
as he that we look for our safety and that of
our children.”</p>

<p>“My son ever considers it an honour to serve
your Majesties,” was Lady Hamilton’s reply; and
behind her was Gavin, blushing, confused, only half
hearing the Empress Queen’s kind words to him,
but wholly happy.</p>

<p>At midnight, under a brilliant moon, Gavin and
St. Arnaud stood together in the silent street before
Sir Gavin Hamilton’s splendid house. The
great door was slightly ajar, and occasionally Lady
Hamilton’s figure passed in front of it.</p>

<p>“Go in,” said St. Arnaud, in a quiet, determined
voice. “Your father has asked you; your
mother pleaded with you with her eyes. This is
the turning-point. Go in for your mother’s sake.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>
<p>“Yes&mdash;for her sake,” said Gavin after a moment.
In that moment he had lived through the
hardest struggle of his life.</p>

<p>St. Arnaud walked home alone&mdash;and for the first
time Gavin Hamilton slept under his father’s roof.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
